Machine learning is a process that allows machines to learn and improve their abilities based on experiences and data. In simple terms, it's about finding patterns and insights in large datasets to make predictions or recommendations for users or other systems. It is often used in areas such as healthcare, finance, marketing, and e-commerce to enhance decision-making capabilities and drive better outcomes. Machine learning involves the use of algorithms that analyze data and extract knowledge from it, resulting in better model performance and decision-making insights.
