Test-Drive Development is a software development methodology that involves testing and debugging code in real-world situations to identify bugs and usability issues before the final product is released. It involves developing and testing software components or applications in a controlled environment, where bugs can be quickly and easily identified and fixed before deployment. This approach allows developers to validate their software ideas and products during development, providing valuable feedback and insights that can guide further development and improvement of the software.
