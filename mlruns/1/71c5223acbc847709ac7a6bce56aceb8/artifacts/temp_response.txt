The main cause of climate change is human activity, specifically greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Other contributing factors include:

1. Carbon dioxide (CO2) - The most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, which absorbs heat from the Sun and traps it within the planet, causing warming temperatures.

2. Methane (CH4) - Another potent greenhouse gas that is produced by livestock farming practices, deforestation, and agricultural activities.

3. Nitrous oxide (N2O) - A potent greenhouse gas that is released during fertilizer applications and land-use changes.

4. Methanol (CH3OH) - An organic compound produced by biomass, such as corn stalks or algae, which can be further converted into methane through fermentation processes.

5. Water vapor (H2O) - A natural greenhouse gas that is a result of precipitation and evaporation, particularly in tropical regions.

These emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, which warms the Earth's surface by trapping heat inside the planet. As the climate continues to warm due to increased greenhouse gas emissions, the effects on ecosystems, agriculture, and human societies will become more severe.
