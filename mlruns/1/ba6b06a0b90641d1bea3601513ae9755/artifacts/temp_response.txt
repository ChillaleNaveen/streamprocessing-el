A/B Testing or also known as Split Testing, is a process that involves launching two versions of an advertising campaign with different elements such as text, images, colors, and headlines to evaluate which one performs better. This approach allows marketers to determine which variant is more effective based on user feedback, conversion rates, or other key performance indicators (KPIs). In A/B testing, a single version of the campaign is tested, while a separate version is created for each test subject. The goal of A/B testing is to find out which variation performs better and optimize the campaign accordingly.
