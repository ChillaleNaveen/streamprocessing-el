Design patterns in software refer to patterned solutions to common problems that arise during the development process, providing a reusable and modular approach for building complex systems. Design patterns enable developers to write code that is repeatable, maintainable, and scalable, reducing the time and effort required to create new functionality. They are generally organized into categories based on their application domain or specific implementation issues. These patterns can be used in various programming languages and platforms, such as Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript.
