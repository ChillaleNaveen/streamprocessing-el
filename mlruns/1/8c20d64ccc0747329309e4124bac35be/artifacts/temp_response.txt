LaTeX functions, commonly known as lambda functions or anonymous functions in Python, are a powerful and versatile tool in mathematics and computer science. They provide a simple and concise way to define and call functions in an object-oriented programming environment. Here's how they work:

Lambda functions take zero or more arguments and return a single value. Each argument is passed by reference and all are evaluated once before returning the final result. Here's a simple example of how lambda functions can be used in Python:

```python
def sum_of_squares(num):
    """
    Calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers
    :param num: the list of numbers to calculate the sum for
    :return: the sum of squares of the given list
    """
    return sum(map(lambda x: x**2, num))

print(sum_of_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # 15
```

In this example, we're calling the "sum_of_squares" lambda function with a list of numbers, and passing in each element individually as an argument. The lambda expression takes no arguments but returns a single value (the sum of squares of the given list).
