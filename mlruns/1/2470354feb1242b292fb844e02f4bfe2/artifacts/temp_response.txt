Biodiversity is a field of study that focuses on the relationship between living organisms and their environment, including the diverse types of species that inhabit different habitats or ecosystems. It is often used as an umbrella term to encompass various subfields such as ecology, ecological dynamics, biodiversity assessment, and conservation biology. In biodiversity, we study how different organisms interact with each other and the environment, including their distribution patterns, reproductive strategies, physiological adaptations, and interactions with non-living factors such as climate change and pollution.
