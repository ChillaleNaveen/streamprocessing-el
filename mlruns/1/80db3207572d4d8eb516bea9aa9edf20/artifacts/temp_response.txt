Cloud computing is an ecosystem of services, tools, and resources that reside in the cloud, allowing users to access them via the internet. A metaphor for this system could be likened to a vast network of interconnected nodes, each with its own unique capabilities and features. The nodes are connected through various technologies, including virtualized hardware, software-defined networking, and cloud-based storage and management services, allowing users to access the resources they need when and where they need them.
