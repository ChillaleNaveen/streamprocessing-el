Feature Engineering is a process of extracting and transforming data that can be used for predictive modeling, data analysis, and decision-making. It involves gathering and analyzing data in various forms (e.g., categorical or numerical variables) to create new features that are more likely to capture the underlying trends and patterns in the data. By leveraging these new features, models can be developed with better generalization abilities and greater predictive power. Feature engineering is a crucial step in building effective machine learning algorithms and improving their performance.
