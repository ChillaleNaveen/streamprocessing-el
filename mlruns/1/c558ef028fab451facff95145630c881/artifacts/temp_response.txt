Microservices is a software development model that breaks down a large application into smaller, independent services or components that can be deployed independently and scaled based on demand. It involves designing applications in a modular fashion to enable more agile development and improved scalability. By breaking down the application into small, independent services, developers can focus on each service's functionality rather than having to deal with the entire application at once, which leads to greater flexibility and faster development cycles. Microservices have become increasingly popular in recent years as software development trends shift towards more modular and reusable components, better scaling, and easier maintenance and management.
