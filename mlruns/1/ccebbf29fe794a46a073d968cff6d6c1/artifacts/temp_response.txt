Blockchain technology is a decentralized, public ledger system that is used to secure and record data. It works by creating immutable records called blocks that are linked together in a chain, forming a transparent and tamper-proof digital record of transactions and transactions. Each block contains information about previous blocks, making it difficult for anyone to change or add to the data without being noticed. This system is designed to eliminate the need for intermediaries such as banks or third-party verifiers, providing transparency, security, and trust in transactions. It's also very useful for things like cryptocurrency, finance, healthcare, and other industries that rely on secure and transparent data sharing.
