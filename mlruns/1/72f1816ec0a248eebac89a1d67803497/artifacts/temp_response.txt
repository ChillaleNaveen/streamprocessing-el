The purpose of normalization in database design is to create a consistent and standardized structure for data that is easier to retrieve, search, manipulate, and update. Normalization involves breaking down complex relationships between tables into smaller, simpler ones, creating a hierarchy or tree-like structure, and ensuring that all related data stays within its own table. By normalizing data, it becomes easier to maintain and update the database, as all changes and updates are made at the same level in the hierarchy, rather than having to navigate through multiple levels of tables to update a single piece of data. This can also help prevent data inconsistencies, ensuring that all related data stays within its own table, making it easier for search engines and other applications to access and retrieve data efficiently.
