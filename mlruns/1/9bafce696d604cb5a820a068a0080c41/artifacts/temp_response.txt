Design patterns in software refer to various principles and practices that can be used to improve the overall development process of software applications. Design patterns are abstractions or patterns for solving specific software problems, and they are typically implemented through code snippets or classes that can be easily reused across different projects. The design patterns have been proven to help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and testable code, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in software development.
