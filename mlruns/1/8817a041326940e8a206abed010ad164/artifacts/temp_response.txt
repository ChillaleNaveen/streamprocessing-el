To read a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file in Python, you can use the `csv` library and its various functions. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('my_csv_file.csv', mode='r') as my_csv_file:
    # Read the contents of the CSV file into a Python list
    data = [line for line in csv.reader(my_csv_file)]
```

This code creates a new `csv.reader` object, reads the CSV file into a Python list (`data`), and prints it to the console. You can replace `'my_csv_file.csv'` with the name of your actual CSV file for more specific results.
