Database normalization is a process of designing and maintaining relational databases to ensure data consistency, integrity, and efficiency. It involves grouping related tables and columns into logical entities called constraints or constraints groups. This helps to ensure that data is stored in the correct order, with the primary key (or unique identifier) at the beginning, and that data can be easily accessed by other queries or tables. Normalization also aids in query optimization by reducing the number of joins needed between related tables. In summary, database normalization helps to improve database performance and maintainability while ensuring integrity and data consistency.
