The analogical relationship between neural networks and analogue hardware is described by saying that neural networks are analogous to analogue hardware in terms of their fundamental principles, functions, and operations. In contrast to the traditional notions of digital logic, neural networks use non-linearities such as activation functions and hidden layers to represent complex signals or data patterns. They also employ non-uniform neuron connectivity and weight updates in order to maximize the network's output performance while minimizing its input requirements. The overall structure, training process, and computational complexity of neural networks are similar to analogue hardware.
