Containerization and Docker are both software development techniques that allow developers to deploy applications in a scalable, portable, and self-contained environment. In simple terms, containerization separates an application's logic, dependencies, and data from its operating system, while Docker provides a standardized way to package and ship these components as a single unit.

Containerization allows developers to build and deploy applications faster by minimizing the time it takes to move an application from one environment (e.g., development, testing, staging, production) to another. This process is known as containerization or container building, and involves creating a virtual container image that includes all necessary dependencies and data.

Docker provides an open-source toolkit for running containers, which enables developers to easily build, run, and manage containers on any platform. Docker has become a popular choice for many organizations because it allows for greater flexibility in deploying applications, reduces the risk of downtime, and improves collaboration between teams.

In summary, containerization separates an application's logic, dependencies, and data from its operating system, while Docker provides a standardized way to package and ship these components as a single unit.
