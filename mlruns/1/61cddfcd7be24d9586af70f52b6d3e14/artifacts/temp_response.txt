Market segmentation is a strategic approach to identifying and analyzing the needs, preferences, and behaviors of specific groups of customers within a broader market. It involves breaking down the total customer base into smaller, more focused segments based on various criteria such as demographics (age, gender, income), psychographics (attitudes, values, lifestyles), behavior, interests, and needs. By segmenting the market, businesses can tailor their offerings, prices, messaging, and advertising to better meet the needs and preferences of each segment.
