Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to train and test an algorithm on a separate set of data, usually known as the "training set," and then using the predictions from that set to evaluate how well the model performs on new, unseen data. This process helps to identify whether or not the model has learned to generalize to novel situations, which can improve its accuracy and usefulness for real-world applications.
