Fossil fuels are non-renewable and finite resources derived from organic matter that has been preserved over millions of years. They include coal, oil, and natural gas. These substances are used for energy generation, such as power plants or transportation, by burning them in an oxygen-poor environment or extracting them through drilling and extraction processes.
