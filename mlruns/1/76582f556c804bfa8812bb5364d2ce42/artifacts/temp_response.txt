A Python generator is an iterative command that generates output continuously without stopping. Generators are often used in Python for data processing and data science applications, as they allow you to process large datasets quickly and efficiently. Here's how to use a Python generator:

1. Define the function: First, define the function using the `def` keyword and defining what output it generates. For example:

```python
def generate_numbers(start, stop, step):
    num = start
    while True:
        yield num
        num += step
```

2. Call the function: To use the generator, call it with an iterable as the argument. Here's an example:

```python
gen_numbers = generate_numbers(0, 10, 5)
for num in gen_numbers:
    print(num)
```

This code will print out each number generated by the generator. Here's how the generator works:

- When the function is called with an iterable as its argument, it returns a generator object.
- The generator object allows you to iterate over all values in the iterable continuously without stopping.
- You can call `next` on the generator to retrieve the next value.

That's how generators work in Python!
