Database normalization is the process of creating and maintaining consistent and structured relationships between data entities in a relational database. It helps to minimize errors, optimize query performance, and ensure data consistency across all tables and columns in a database. Normalization involves breaking down data into smaller, more manageable entities and relationships that are easier to understand and maintain. It is an essential step in building robust and scalable databases, ensuring the integrity of data, and reducing costs associated with managing large amounts of data.
