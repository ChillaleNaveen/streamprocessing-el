Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and some other organisms, including algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy (photons) into chemical energy (glucose) through a series of reactions. In photosynthesis, light (radiant energy in the visible spectrum) stimulates the enzyme chlorophyll to absorb energy from the sun's photons and transfer it to other molecules within the plant or algae. The chlorophyll then uses the absorbed energy to break down water into oxygen gas (O2) and carbon dioxide gas (CO2), which is released as a byproduct. This chemical reaction, in turn, produces glucose (sugar), which is stored in the plant or used for growth and other metabolic processes. In summary, photosynthesis involves light absorption, energy transfer from chlorophyll to other molecules, and conversion of glucose into oxygen gas and sugar through a series of chemical reactions within cells and tissues of the plant or algae.
