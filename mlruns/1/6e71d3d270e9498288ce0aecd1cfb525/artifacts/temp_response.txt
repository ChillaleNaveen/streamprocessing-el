Microservices is a software development approach that breaks down large applications into modular, loosely coupled services. The concept of microservices was initially introduced by Google in its application architecture for its Android platform, and it has since been adopted by other organizations who want to break down their applications into smaller, more manageable components. Microservices allow developers to focus on building individual services while still being able to use them as a whole to provide a seamless user experience. This approach can help reduce costs, improve scalability, and enhance the overall user experience of applications.
