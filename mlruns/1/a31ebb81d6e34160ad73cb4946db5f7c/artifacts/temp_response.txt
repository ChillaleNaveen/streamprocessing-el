Test-driven (also known as beta) development refers to the process of testing a new application or software before it is released to the general public. It involves giving developers and users an early access to the software, allowing them to provide feedback and identify any bugs or issues before they are officially launched. In test-driven development, developers write tests that ensure that the software meets specific requirements, and then programmers write code based on these tests, ensuring that it meets those same requirements. This cycle of writing tests and coding continues until the software is deemed ready for final release.
