Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software development paradigm that promotes software design by dividing applications into reusable objects and encapsulating their behavior. It enables developers to write code in an organized, structured way that follows logical and predictable patterns. In OOP, classes are the building blocks of objects, and methods represent behaviors of objects. Objects can have multiple instances of themselves, and each instance has its own unique set of attributes and behaviors. OOP allows for more efficient code execution and makes it easier to maintain and modify applications.
