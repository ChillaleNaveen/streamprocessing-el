A name for a coding bootcamp could be "Code Boot Camp" or "Coding Boot Camp". These names are catchy, memorable, and reflect the essence of what the bootcamp offers - teaching programming skills to aspiring coders. It is also a clever blend of the words "code" and "bootcamp", which speaks to both the technical nature of coding and the immersive learning environment that the bootcamp provides.
