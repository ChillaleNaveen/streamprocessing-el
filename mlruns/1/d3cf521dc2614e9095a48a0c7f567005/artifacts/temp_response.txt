Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging field of technology that allows machines to think and behave like humans, including in areas such as problem-solving, decision-making, and communication. AI systems can be programmed to analyze large amounts of data, learn from experience, and make decisions based on their knowledge and experience. In the context of software development, AI refers to a set of algorithms, functions, and models that automate tasks and processes, improving efficiency, accuracy, and quality while reducing costs for organizations using AI-driven solutions.
