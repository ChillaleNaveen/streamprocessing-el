The main difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) lies in their respective approaches to problem-solving. While both are based on data, AI focuses on creating automated systems by training algorithms using large amounts of data, while ML is a more advanced form of AI that allows for the creation of intelligent decision-making systems by analyzing and interpreting complex data sets in real time. In summary, AI is focused on creating autonomous or self-learning systems that can perform complex tasks without the need for human intervention, while ML is used to analyze and interpret complex data sets to make more informed decisions based on artificial intelligence.
