Earthquakes occur when a massive amount of energy is released within the Earth's crust due to subducting tectonic plates, which creates an undersea fault or a volcanic eruption that causes the release of a large amount of pressure into the surrounding rock. The pressure causes the rocks beneath the earth's surface to slip along the fault line, leading to the formation of an earthquake.

Additionally, a strong enough tectonic plate motion can cause the Earth's crust to buckle or "bend", causing some areas to slide past one another (known as seismic waves). This movement creates a wave-like effect that travels along fault lines and triggers earthquakes.
