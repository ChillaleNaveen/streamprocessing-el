Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an engineering and scientific field that involves developing intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically performed by humans, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and self-awareness. AI systems are designed to be self-directed and learn from experiences, enabling them to expand their capabilities and adapt to changes in the environment. This enables AI systems to function independently or collaboratively with humans, making them increasingly useful in various fields such as healthcare, finance, education, transportation, and more.
