Containerization is the process of packaging an application or set of applications into a single unit called a "container". Containers are lightweight, portable and can run on different operating systems, making it easy to deploy, manage and scale applications. Docker is a tool that automates containerization for developers and administrators by providing a simple command line interface (CLI) to create, manage and destroy containers. With Docker, developers can create containerized applications with pre-configured libraries, dependencies and settings, which helps them save time and effort in development and deployment. Containers are designed to run on the same operating system, making it easier for developers to deploy and maintain their applications in a consistent environment. In summary, Docker is an open source tool that allows developers to package and manage applications as containerized units, creating a more efficient and scalable way of deploying, managing and scaling applications.
