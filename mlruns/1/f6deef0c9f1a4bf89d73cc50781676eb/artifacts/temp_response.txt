A/B Testing is a methodology used to compare two versions of a website or marketing campaign, typically with different elements such as images, text, calls-to-action (CTAs), and layouts. The goal is to determine which version performs better in terms of conversion rate, engagement, and overall user experience (UX). By testing these variations, businesses can identify the most effective way to optimize their campaigns for maximum results.
