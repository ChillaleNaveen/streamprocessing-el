Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a coding style and approach to program development that focuses on designing software systems with objects, or data structures, as the primary building blocks. OOP employs a class-based model for defining and manipulating object properties and relationships, resulting in more complex and flexible systems.

In OOP, classes are abstract data types that define the structure of objects within a system. Objects are instances of these classes, and methods are defined to manipulate and interact with those objects. Relationships between objects (e.g., Parent-child) are expressed through inheritance, which allows subclasses to inherit properties from their superclass. This approach enables OOP to define complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units.

Overall, object-oriented programming promotes better code structure and maintainability, as well as greater flexibility and scalability in software development. It has become a popular coding style due to its widespread use in a variety of industries, including the finance, healthcare, and e-commerce sectors, among others.
