Database normalization, also known as entity relationship diagram (ERD), is a principle in database design that tries to minimize repetitive data and optimize database performance by creating a relational model that represents objects as entities with relationships between them. It aims to avoid data duplication, inconsistency, and complexity while ensuring efficient access and maintenance of the data. In essence, it helps to create an organized and logical database design that is easy to manage and maintain over time.
