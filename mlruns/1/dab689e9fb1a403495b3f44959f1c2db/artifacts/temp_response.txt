Database normalization is a technique used to improve database performance by reducing redundancy, improving readability and maintaining consistency. It involves breaking down complex tables into simpler ones, which minimizes the number of joins required between them and reduces data duplication, leading to improved query performance. By following database normalization best practices, developers can create a more efficient and reliable database that meets their business needs.
