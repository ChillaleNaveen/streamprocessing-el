Renewable Energy refers to energy sources that are harnessed over and over again, without running out or depleting. This includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass energy sources, among others. Renewables are sustainable and produce no greenhouse gas emissions, making them an excellent alternative to non-renewable resources that contribute to climate change.
