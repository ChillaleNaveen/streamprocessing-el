Renewable Energy refers to energy sources that can be replenished on a continuous or sustained basis, such as sunlight, wind, water, and biomass. It encompasses various types of energy, including solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, hydropower dams, biogas, geothermal, hydrogen fuel cells, and others. Renewable energy sources are considered sustainable because they can be replenished naturally or through recycling or reusing the same resources. They also help mitigate climate change by reducing the need for fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
