Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a technique used to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in large datasets. It involves the exploration of raw data using statistical methods such as regression, correlation, and clustering, as well as visualization tools like heat maps or scatter plots. The goal of exploratory data analysis is to gain insights into the underlying structure and dynamics of a dataset, which can help to inform decision-making processes.
