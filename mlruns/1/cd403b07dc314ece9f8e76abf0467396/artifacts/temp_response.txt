Database normalization, also known as schema normalization or entity relationship diagram (ERD) normalization, is a technique used in database design to ensure that data entities are related and consistent. It is a process of breaking down complex relational structures into simpler, standardized ones to improve the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the database. By normalizing database entities, it enables data to be easily queried, updated, and deleted with minimal impact on the overall structure of the database.
