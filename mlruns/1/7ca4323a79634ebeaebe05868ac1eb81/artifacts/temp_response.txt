REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs refer to an architectural style that defines a set of rules for building and consuming web applications using HTTP requests and responses. In REST, the client (usually a browser or mobile application) sends a GET request to the server (usually a web server or API gateway), which returns a response with data in JSON format. The server then uses this information to update its own state to reflect any changes made by the client. This allows for seamless and efficient communication between the client and server, making it an ideal architecture for large-scale and complex web applications.
