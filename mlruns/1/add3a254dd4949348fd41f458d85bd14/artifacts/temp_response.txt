Exploratory data analysis (EDA) refers to a process of uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in large datasets. It involves analyzing different types of data, such as numerical, categorical, and textual, to gain insights into the underlying characteristics, trends, and relationships within the dataset. The goal of exploratory EDA is to identify new insights from the data that were not apparent through traditional statistical methods. This process can be used in various industries and fields, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and beyond.
