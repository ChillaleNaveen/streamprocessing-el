ROI (return on investment) is a metric used to evaluate and analyze the financial performance of an investment or project. It measures the difference between the amount of money earned by a company due to a specific investment compared to what was invested.

The ROI calculation involves two basic steps:

1. Calculating expected income (profit) - This is the amount of revenue that would have been generated if the investment had not occurred.

2. Calculating return on investment (ROI) - This is the ratio between the expected income and the actual income. The ROI calculation is based on the following formula:

ROI = (Expected Income x 1) / Investment Amount (1)

For example, let's say you invested $10,000 in a startup company with a 5% annual return. The expected income for the first year is $20,000, and the actual income is $30,000. To calculate the ROI, you would use the following formula:

ROI = (Expected Income x 1) / Investment Amount (1)

= ($20,000 x 1) / $10,000 (1)

= 3.33%

In this example, the ROI calculation shows that for every dollar invested, the startup company generated a return of approximately 3.33%. So, if you had invested in the startup with a return of 5%, your investment would have generated returns of $10,692.
