Lambda functions are a JavaScript function expression that allows you to define and invoke a single function using the arrow function syntax. They can be used in a variety of contexts, including building complex functional programs, implementing state management patterns, and as a way to encapsulate business logic. In general, lambda functions are designed to reduce code duplication, simplify the execution flow, and make it easier to test and maintain your code. They can also be used to create reusable and scalable components or libraries in JavaScript.
