Database Normalization refers to the process of designing and maintaining a relational database with consistent and logical relationships between data entities (tables) to improve data integrity, reduce data redundancy, and enhance efficiency. It involves creating and maintaining tables with unique primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints that ensure data consistency and prevent data corruption or data duplication. Normalization helps in better use of resources by reducing the number of database tables required, improving scalability and reducing the risk of database errors or inconsistencies.
