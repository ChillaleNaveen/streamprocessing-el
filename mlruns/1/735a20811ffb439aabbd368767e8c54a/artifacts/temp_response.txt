A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm that helps to identify the most suitable decision for each node in an input dataset. The decision tree works by creating a hierarchy or tree structure, starting from the root and branching out to individual nodes representing possible options. Each branch leads to a subtree consisting of specific subsets of features and outcomes. At each node, the algorithm compares the value assigned to each feature with the corresponding outcome. If any feature has a higher value than the outcome, the decision is taken in favor of that feature. The algorithm continues this process until all branches have been explored or all possible decisions have been made. The resulting tree structure represents the most likely outcomes based on the data available at each node.
