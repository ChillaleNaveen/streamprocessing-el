REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are an architecture pattern that enables communication between web services using HTTP. These APIs follow the RESTful principles, which emphasize:

1. Uniform interface: A single URL is used to access a resource on a server.

2. Hypermedia as the engine of application state: Resource representations (e.g., JSON) are used for hypermedia links, allowing clients to navigate and retrieve data in an intuitive way.

3. Client-oriented: APIs are designed with the client in mind, providing clear and easy-to-understand responses that align with their needs and expectations.

4. Stateless: Web services are stateless, meaning they don't store or persist data between requests. This helps to reduce server load and improves performance.

5. Concurrent: REST APIs can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking other requests.

Overall, REST APIs provide a consistent and easy-to-understand way of accessing resources on the web, which is essential for modern web applications that require interoperability, scalability, and user experience.
