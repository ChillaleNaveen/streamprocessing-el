Renewable energy refers to sustainable sources of energy that can be replenished over time, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power. These energy sources are generated through natural processes such as the sun's radiation or water's movement, without needing to burn fossil fuels or other non-renewable resources. Renewable energy is a vital component of a sustainable future, as it helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
