Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and preparing data to create useful features for machine learning models. It involves identifying and describing the attributes of a dataset that are most relevant or important for predictive modeling, while also ensuring that these features are clean, balanced, and not too complex. Feature engineering helps in improving the model's accuracy by enabling algorithms to make better predictions based on the available information. It is a crucial step in building effective machine learning models.
