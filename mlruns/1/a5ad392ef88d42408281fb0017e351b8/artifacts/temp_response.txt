Database normalization is a process that helps to improve the efficiency and scalability of relational databases by minimizing redundancy, optimizing data structure, and enforcing consistency and integrity. It involves creating a consistent schema for the database, which means designing tables with a clear relationship between their fields, using primary keys and foreign keys, and avoiding duplicate or redundant data. Normalization ensures that tables are not too large, that constraints are in place to enforce constraints, and that data is easily readable and editable. By following normalization, databases can be designed to handle increased database growth, improved query performance, and a more scalable architecture.
