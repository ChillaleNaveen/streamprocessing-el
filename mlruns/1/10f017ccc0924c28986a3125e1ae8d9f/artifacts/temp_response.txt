The main distinction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is in their respective approaches to problem-solving. While both technologies are based on artificial intelligence, ML specifically focuses on developing algorithms that can learn and adapt automatically from data. In contrast, AI aims to create intelligent systems that perform specific tasks without requiring any form of human intervention or guidance.

AI is often used in applications such as self-driving cars, chatbots, virtual assistants, and digital assistants, while ML can be applied in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. In general, AI focuses on developing intelligent algorithms that can learn from data to perform tasks more efficiently than humans could alone. While ML is a subset of AI, it involves building models to achieve specific goals rather than general intelligence.
