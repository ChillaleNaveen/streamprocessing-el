A/B Testing is a strategy used to determine which version of an online advertisement, content, or design will be most effective in achieving the intended outcome. It involves dividing users into two groups and evaluating their behavior in different situations, such as landing pages, product pages, or sales pages. By comparing the results, marketers can choose the best option to optimize their campaigns and improve their performance.
