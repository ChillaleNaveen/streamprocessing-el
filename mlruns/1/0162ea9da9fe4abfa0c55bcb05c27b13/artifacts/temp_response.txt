Analogy: APIs are like bridges that connect applications and systems, allowing them to communicate with each other. Just as a bridge spans a gulf or gap between two landmasses, APIs allow software applications from different platforms to interact seamlessly. In this analogy, the bridge is the API, and the gaps or differences are the obstacles that can be bridged over. By bridging these silos, APIs make it possible for developers to build innovative and interoperable systems, thereby accelerating business growth and improving efficiency in various industries.
