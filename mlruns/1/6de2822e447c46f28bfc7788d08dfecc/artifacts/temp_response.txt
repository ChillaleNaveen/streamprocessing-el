Fossil fuels are chemical compounds that were formed from living organisms in the past, particularly during the Carboniferous period. These organic molecules contain a significant amount of carbon and have been used as a source of energy for millions of years. Fossil fuels are typically derived from coal, oil, and natural gas, which come from the remains of plants and animals that lived over 300 million years ago. The use of fossil fuel has significantly impacted the world's economy and played a crucial role in human history.
