The process typically involves identifying and defining project goals, creating a project plan, assigning tasks to team members, monitoring progress, resolving issues, and closing out the project successfully. Project managers work closely with team members to ensure that each member is responsible for their assigned tasks and that they are accountable for meeting project deadlines and delivering quality results. They also facilitate communication between stakeholders and manage the project's resources, ensuring that timely deliverables are produced within budget constraints. Overall, project management involves a complex set of interdependent activities that require careful planning, coordination, and execution to ensure success at all times.
