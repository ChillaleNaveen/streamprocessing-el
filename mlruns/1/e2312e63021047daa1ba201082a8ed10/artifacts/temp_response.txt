Market segmentation is a strategic approach used to identify and target customers based on their specific needs, preferences, and behaviors. It involves analyzing different segments of the population based on various characteristics such as age, gender, income level, location, interests, and lifestyle. By dividing the overall customer base into smaller groups based on these criteria, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to better meet the needs and preferences of each segment. This helps in improving brand loyalty, increasing sales, and achieving greater market share.
