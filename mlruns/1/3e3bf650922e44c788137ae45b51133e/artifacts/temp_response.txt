Generators in Python are a type of constructors that allow you to create objects dynamically based on input parameters. They are useful for creating reusable and complex data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and classes. Here's how they work:

1. Define the Generator Class: The first step is to define a class that inherits from the `Iterator` class in Python. The class should have a `__next__()` method that returns the next item in the sequence.

```python
class MyGenerator(Iterator):
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator:
        return self

    def __next__(self) -> int:
        try:
            # get next item from the iterator
            return next(self)
        except StopIteration:
            # If there are no more items, raise StopIteration
            raise StopIteration()
```

2. Create an `Iterator` object: The second step is to create an instance of your generator class. The `__iter__()` method will create a new iterator for each call to `next()`.

```python
my_generator = MyGenerator()
while True:
    try:
        item = next(my_generator)
    except StopIteration:
        break
```

3. Use the Generator Class with your Python code: Now, you can use your generator class to create objects dynamically based on input parameters. For example, you could create a list of integers:

```python
my_list = []
for num in range(10):
    my_list.append(num)
```

And you could create a dictionary with key-value pairs:

```python
my_dict = {}
for num, name in [('a', 'apple'), ('b', 'banana')]:
    my_dict[name] = num
```

In both cases, the generated objects are constructed based on the input parameters.
