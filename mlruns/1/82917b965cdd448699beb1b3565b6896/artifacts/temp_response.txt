Test-Driven Development is an iterative software development methodology that involves creating a working prototype or application using a small amount of code, testing it thoroughly, and refining the final product based on user feedback. This approach allows developers to quickly test their ideas and receive valuable feedback before investing significant time and resources into the actual production version.
