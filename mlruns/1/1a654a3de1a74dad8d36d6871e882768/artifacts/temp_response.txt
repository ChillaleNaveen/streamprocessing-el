Database normalization, also known as database design, is a process of creating a consistent and structured structure for a relational database. It is an important concept in database management systems (DBMS) to ensure data consistency and avoiding unnecessary redundancies, which can lead to performance issues and other problems. In a database normalized schema, tables are defined with primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships between them to reflect the underlying data relationships within the system. This helps maintain data integrity, ensures data consistency, and reduces the number of queries required to retrieve specific data. By following database normalization, DBMS designers can minimize data migration issues, improve query performance, and enhance system scalability.
