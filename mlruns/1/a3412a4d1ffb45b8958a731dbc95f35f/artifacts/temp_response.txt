Cross-validation, also known as cross-fold or train-test splitting, is a technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model by splitting it into training and testing datasets. The idea behind cross-validation is to separate the data into two parts: a training set that contains a portion of the data for the model to learn from and a validation set that contains a portion of the data that will not be used for learning but will be used for evaluating the model's performance. By doing so, the algorithm can be trained on the training set while evaluating its performance on the validation set, which is a smaller subset of the training set. This process helps to identify and correct any potential problems in the model, such as overfitting or underfitting, by ensuring that the model's performance is not affected by the splitting process.
