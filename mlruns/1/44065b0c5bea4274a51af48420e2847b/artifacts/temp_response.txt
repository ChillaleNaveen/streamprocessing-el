Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into chemical energy. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of these organisms, located within the cells of the plant or algal cell. In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy through the process of ATP synthesis. The ATP molecule then undergoes several steps to produce a stable chemical structure, including phosphorylation (adding a phosphate group) and glycolysis (carrying out the first step in the biochemical pathway). This process is called photosynthesis because it involves photons or light energy as a source of energy.
