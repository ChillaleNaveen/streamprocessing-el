Vaccines work by exposing our bodies to a weakened or inactivated version of the virus, causing our immune systems to develop antibodies that can recognize and fight off the real virus. This process teaches our bodies to recognize and defend against the real virus, which protects us from getting sick if we come into contact with the infected person or virus. By developing an immunity to the virus, our bodies are able to fend off future infections or outbreaks.
