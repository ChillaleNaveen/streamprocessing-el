Overfitting in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where models that are trained on a small subset of data may become overfitted or mislead the model's predictions when applied to unseen, larger datasets. In other words, the model's performance on the training dataset (which contains only the features used to train it) is likely to be good but not as good as its performance on the test dataset (which contains additional features and data), which may contain information that the model has not learned or ignored during training. This can lead to overfitting, where the model's predictions are too influenced by the training data, making it less generalizable to new data. Overfitting can be mitigated through regularization techniques such asDropout, L2 regularization, and weight initialization.
