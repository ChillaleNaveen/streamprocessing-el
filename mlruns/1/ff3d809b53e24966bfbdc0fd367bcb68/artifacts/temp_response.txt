Sure! Here's how to use regular expressions in Python:

1. Import the re module, which is used for regular expression handling:

   ```python
   import re
   ```

2. Create a pattern string using regular expression syntax (e.g., `r"pattern"`):

   ```python
   pattern = r"name\s*=\s*"
   ```

3. Use the "re.search()" function to search for matches in a given string:

   ```python
   matches = re.findall(pattern, str_to_search)
   ```

4. Extract all matching text from the matches list using "re.sub()" to replace it with your desired text:

   ```python
   new_string = str_to_search.replace(matches[0], "replacement")
   ```

That's it! You can now use regular expressions in Python and manipulate data as you please.
