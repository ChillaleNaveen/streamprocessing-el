Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful technique used to develop and improve algorithms based on large amounts of data. It enables AI systems to learn from experiences and make decisions based on past data. ML involves a combination of statistical modeling, algorithmic optimization, and machine learning techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

In simple terms, ML is used to solve complex problems by developing algorithms that can analyze and interpret data, making informed decisions based on past experiences. It has numerous applications in areas such as healthcare, finance, retail, and more. By leveraging the power of large datasets and advanced machine learning techniques, ML-based solutions enable organizations to make better decisions and improve overall outcomes.
