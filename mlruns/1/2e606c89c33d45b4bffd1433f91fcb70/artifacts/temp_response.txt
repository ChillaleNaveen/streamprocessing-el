Renewable energy refers to any form of energy that is generated using natural resources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. These types of energy are sustainable and renewable because they can be replenished naturally over time without running out or depleting. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly popular around the world due to their environmental benefits and economic advantages.
