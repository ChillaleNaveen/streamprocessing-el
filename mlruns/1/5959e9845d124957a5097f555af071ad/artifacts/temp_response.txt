Cross-validation is a method used in machine learning and other fields to selectively split data into training and testing sets. It allows for the evaluation of models with different splits, which can be useful when performing hyperparameter optimization or ensuring generalization capabilities of trained models. In the context of AI, cross-validation is typically employed during model development and is particularly beneficial in situations where a small number of data points are available to train on.
