REST (Representational State Transfer) is a web application architecture pattern that allows developers to define data exchange mechanisms between client and server via URLs, HTTP requests, and responses. It promotes model-view-controller (MVC) architecture by separating the representation layer (RESTful API) from the business logic (controllers) using a uniform URL structure. REST APIs are designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to test, making them an ideal choice for building web applications with large data sets or complex features.
