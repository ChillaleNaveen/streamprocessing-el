Biodiversity refers to the diverse and abundant biological species that exist in a given ecosystem or environment. It comprises all living organisms, from single-celled microorganisms to large mammals, birds, and animals of different sizes and shapes. Biotas are composed of various types of organisms (plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria) that interact with each other in a specific ecosystem, depending on the type of habitat they occupy.
