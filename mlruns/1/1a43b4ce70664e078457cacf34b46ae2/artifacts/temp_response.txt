Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts the weights (or parameters) of a machine learning model based on the gradients of the loss function with respect to each parameter. Here's how it works:

1. Define the objective function (e.g., loss function) you are optimizing.

2. Calculate the gradient, or derivative, of the objective function with respect to each parameter. This gradient can be calculated using the backpropagation algorithm, which is a common optimization technique used in deep learning and machine learning.

3. Update the weights based on these gradients by subtracting the gradients from their corresponding parameter values.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the objective function (or loss) converges or the convergence is impossible.

In summary, gradient descent iteratively adjusts the weights of a machine learning model based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.
