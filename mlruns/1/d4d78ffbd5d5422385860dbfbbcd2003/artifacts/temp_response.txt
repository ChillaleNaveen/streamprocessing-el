To handle exceptions in Python, you can use the try-except block structure:

```python
try:
    # code that may throw a specific exception
except Exception as error_type:
    print("Error:", str(error_type))
except:
    print("Something went wrong.")
```

Here, the `try` block executes the code until it encounters an exception. The `except` block catches that specific exception and prints its message using the `str()` function and a default message if no error was caught. If you need to handle multiple exceptions in one try-except block, use a list of exception types:

```python
try:
    # code that may throw a specific exception or some other exceptions
except Exception as error_type1, error_type2:
    print("Error:", str(error_type1), "and", str(error_type2))
except:
    print("Something went wrong.")
```
