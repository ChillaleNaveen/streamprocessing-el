A/B Testing, also known as Split Testing or Eight-Testing, is a type of experiment used in digital marketing to compare two or more versions of an online advertisement, product, or landing page to determine which one performs better. The goal is to optimize the ad or page for maximum impact and click-through rates (CTR) while minimizing cost. By running multiple variations of the same ad, website, or campaign, businesses can identify the most effective way to communicate their message and reach their target audience.
