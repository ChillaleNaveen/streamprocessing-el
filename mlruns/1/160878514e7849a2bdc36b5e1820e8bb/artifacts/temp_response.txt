To create an analogue for neural networks, we can consider their structure as a mathematical model that approximates the behavior of biological neurons. Biological neurons are composed of two or more interconnected neurons, which transmit information through electrical signals. In contrast to traditional digital computers, which operate on binary logic, neural networks use a more complex and adaptive representation of information in terms of weights and connections between neurons. By simulating this network structure in mathematical form, we can create analogues that mimic the functioning and behavior of biological neurons.

For example, let's consider a simple case of a linear network where each neuron has one input and one output. If we connect all inputs to the same neuron and set all weights to 1, then the output of any given input will be a weighted sum of the inputs. In this case, it is easy to see that the output of a single input (given that all inputs have been connected) will reflect the weighted average of the corresponding inputs.

Similarly, if we connect each neuron to its own set of input neurons and weights, then the outputs of different inputs will be weighted sums of the outputs of their respective inputs. This is analogous to how neurons in a biological neural network can transmit information based on the strength of connections between inputs.

In summary, a neural network can be viewed as a mathematical model that represents the functioning and behavior of biological neurons, which are composed of multiple interconnected neurons that use weighted sum operations to transmit information through electrical signals.
