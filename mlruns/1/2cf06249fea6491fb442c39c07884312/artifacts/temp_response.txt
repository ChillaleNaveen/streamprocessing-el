Renewable Energy refers to any energy source that can be replenished naturally or through sustainable practices, such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. Renewable energy is considered sustainable because it does not depend on finite resources like fossil fuels, which are finite in nature and cannot be replenished.
