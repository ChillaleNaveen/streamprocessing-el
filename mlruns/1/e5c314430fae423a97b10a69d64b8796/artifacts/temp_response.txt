Cross-validation, also known as k-fold or leave-one-out validation, is a method used in machine learning to assess the generalization ability of a predictive model. It involves splitting a dataset into k subsets (also called folds), with each subset containing a single record from the original dataset. The training and testing sets are then obtained from different folds, providing a "cross-validation" effect that allows for an accurate evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. This is important because it helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training set and that its generalization ability has not been compromised by the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
