LaMBA (Lambda Functions) is a programming concept that allows you to define a single function that can be reused across multiple programs or files. LaMBA functions are highly optimized and efficient, allowing for faster execution time and less memory usage compared to traditional functions. They run within a virtual environment known as the "lambda runtime," which provides security, performance, and simplicity benefits for developers. With laMBA, you can write reusable code and avoid repetitive tasks, making your development process more efficient and streamlined.
