Blockchain technology works by creating and maintaining immutable ledgers of transactions (blocks) using cryptography. Each new block in the chain contains a sequence of previous blocks, which are added together to create a larger blockchain. The blocks are encrypted and stored securely on a distributed network of computers known as nodes. Every node in the network has the same data and can validate new blocks based on consensus among all other nodes. Once a consensus is reached, the new block is added to the chain and becomes the next block in the sequence. This process continues with each new block adding its transactions to the chain, which creates a decentralized ledger that cannot be altered or tampered with by any single entity or individual. The immutability of the data also ensures that no one can modify the history of transactions and create fraudulent accounts or assets.
