Customer relationship management (CRM) is a business concept that involves creating, maintaining, and improving relationships between companies and their customers. It is a systematic approach to managing customer interactions, from sales and marketing to support and service, through the gathering of data, analysis, and decision-making. The goal is to optimize customer value by maximizing sales, retention, and loyalty while minimizing costs and risks. CRM tools, such as customer relationship management software (CRMS), automate and streamline the process, helping businesses stay on top of their customers' needs and preferences.
