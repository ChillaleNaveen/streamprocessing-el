Microservices is a software development methodology that separates large applications into small, independent services, each with its own set of functionality and data. This separation allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and better fault tolerance. Microservices are typically built using microservice architecture patterns such as RESTful APIs, event-driven architectures, and messaging systems. By breaking down the application into smaller, more manageable components, developers can write and maintain code more easily while also improving the overall quality and reliability of the application.
