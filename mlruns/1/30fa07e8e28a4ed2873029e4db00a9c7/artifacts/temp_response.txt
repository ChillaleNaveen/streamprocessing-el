Design patterns in software refer to general patterns and practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining systems. They provide a standardized approach to problem-solving that can be applied across various software development projects. Design patterns are typically used to improve the overall efficiency and robustness of software systems by providing a common set of solutions to common problems. They offer a structured way to organize and structure code, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.
