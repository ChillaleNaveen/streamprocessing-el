Overfitting in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where a model is trained on too much data, resulting in inefficiencies and decreased generalization ability. Overfitting occurs when the training dataset does not reflect the real-world data distribution. In machine learning, overfitting can lead to biased and inaccurate models that are unable to generalize well to new data. This situation is often due to the use of too many training examples or a lack of validation data, which results in the model being overfitted. Overfitting has several consequences, including decreased performance on unseen data, increased computational time and difficulty in tuning hyperparameters, and reduced interpretability. It is important for machine learning practitioners to carefully monitor their models' ability to generalize and adjust training and validation strategies accordingly to avoid overfitting.
