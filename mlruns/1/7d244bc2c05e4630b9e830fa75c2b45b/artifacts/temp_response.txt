ROI (Return on Investment) is a measure used to determine whether an investment or project generates a positive return for the company, organization, or individual. It measures the amount of income generated from the investment compared to the amount spent in capital. ROI can be calculated by dividing the gross profit or revenue from the investment by the cost of capital (i.e., interest payments and any other fixed costs associated with the investment).

ROI is not a static measure, as it fluctuates over time based on various factors such as market trends, business strategies, and performance metrics. It is a crucial metric to determine whether an investment or project is worthwhile for both the company and its stakeholders. By analyzing ROI, companies can identify profitable investments and make more informed decisions about their financial resources.
