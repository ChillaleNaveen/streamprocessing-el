To create an analog of neural networks, we can consider the concept of a computational model or a computational system that is able to perform complex tasks based on input data using iterative and non-linear computations. This analogous model would possess the same set of neural units (neurons), neuron types (types of connections between them), and layers (layers of processing) as the original neural network, while also incorporating additional functionalities such as hidden states or decision boundaries to account for complex data scenarios. It would have a similar structure and architecture, and would be able to learn from data, adapt to new conditions, and make predictions based on its own understanding of the inputs.
