Market segmentation is the process of identifying and classifying customers based on specific characteristics or needs in order to create tailored offers, products, and services that meet their specific needs and preferences. It involves breaking down customers into different segments based on demographics (age, gender, income level), interests, lifestyle, behavior, and psychographic attributes (e.g., attitudes, values, motivations). By segmenting customers, businesses can offer personalized and targeted marketing messages, products, and services that better suit their needs and enhance the overall customer experience. Market segmentation is a critical element of effective marketing strategy that can help companies increase sales, loyalty, and brand awareness.
