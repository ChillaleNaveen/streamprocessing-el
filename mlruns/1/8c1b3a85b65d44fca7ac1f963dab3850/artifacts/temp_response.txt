Pyton generators are a type of Python programming construct that allows developers to create functions and methods without explicitly defining their input parameters, return types, or other attributes. Generators in Python allow code to be generated automatically based on certain conditions, such as while loops, for loops, or iterative processing. Here's how it works:

1. Define the generator function/method with an `yield` statement that specifies the condition for generating a new value. For example, a simple generator function might look like this:

```python
def gen_numbers(start=0, stop=-1):
    if stop == -1:  # endless loop
        yield start
    else:
        yield from [start + n for n in range(stop+1)]
```

2. Define the function or method to be generated as a generator expression (a generator is just a regular Python function with an extra `yield` statement):

```python
def gen_numbers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
```

In this example, the "gen_numbers()" function will generate three values: 1, 2, and 3.

3. Use the `yield` statement in a loop or list comprehension to iterate through the generator:

```python
for num in gen_numbers():
    print(num)
```

In this example, the code prints out each number generated by the generator.

4. A generator can be used for any type of processing that involves generating a sequence or iterating over a collection of data. For example, you could use generators to create and parse CSV files:

```python
import csv

def gen_csv_data():
    data = []
    with open('example.csv', newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            data.append([row[0], row[1]])
    return list(data)  # unpack the data into a list
```

In this example, we create a generator function that returns a list of tuples containing the first and last name of each person in an example CSV file. The code then uses the `gen_csv_data()` function to generate and parse the CSV data as a list of tuples.
