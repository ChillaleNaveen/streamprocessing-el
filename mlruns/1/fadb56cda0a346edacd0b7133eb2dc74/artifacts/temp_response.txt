Fossil fuels are energy sources derived from dead organisms, such as plants and animals, that have been buried in geological formations for millions of years. They include coal, oil, and gas, which are extracted through various methods, such as drilling or fracking. These resources provide a significant source of energy and are crucial to many industrial processes around the world.
