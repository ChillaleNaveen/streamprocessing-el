Sure, here's a Python function that checks if a given number is prime:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """
    Checks if a given number is prime by using the Euclidean algorithm.
    :param num: The number to check for primality.
    :return: True if num is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    # Define the divisors of num
    divisors = [i for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)]
    
    # If the number is not divisible by any element of divisors, it's prime
    if all(x in divisors for x in divisors):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Here's an example usage:

```python
>>> is_prime(10)  # Returns True since 10 is prime
True

>>> is_prime(7)  # Returns False as 7 has no divisors
False

>>> is_prime(36)  # Returns False as 36 has no divisors
False
```
