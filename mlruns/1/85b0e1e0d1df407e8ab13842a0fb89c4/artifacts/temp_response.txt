Photosynthesis, also known as photosynthesis or green plants, is a process in which green and brown algae, cyanobacteria, and some types of plants use light energy from sunlight to produce organic molecules such as carbohydrates (glucose), fats, proteins, and nucleotides (building blocks for DNA). The process begins when a chlorophyll molecule absorbs a photon of light, which triggers the release of electrons that are used by enzymes to transfer energy to other molecules within the plant. This energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds and is later used to produce food or fuel for the plant's growth and survival. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll is the primary pigment responsible for absorbing light energy from sunlight, while the enzyme ATP synthase produces the protons (positive ions) that carry out the electron transport chain, which ultimately transfers electrons to other molecules within the plant. By capturing light energy through chlorophyll, plants can convert sunlight into chemical energy, which is then used for cellular respiration and organelle synthesis, among other things.
