Test-Driven Development is a software engineering methodology that focuses on creating and testing software in a controlled environment, typically on a single device or device type. It involves iterative development cycles with the goal of improving software quality before deployment to production. The approach allows developers to test the functionality and usability of their software solutions early in the development process, allowing for faster feedback loops and better decision-making based on real-world usage data. Test-Driven Development is also known as "Agile" or "Lean" development, and it has become increasingly popular in the software industry as a way to improve productivity, reduce risk, and accelerate software delivery.
