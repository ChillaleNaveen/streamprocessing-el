Overfitting is a type of machine learning that occurs when training data is used to train a model, which may not generalize well to unseen data. It occurs when the dataset used for training contains too many examples of the same or similar classes, making it difficult for the model to learn and generalize to new data. Overfitting can lead to poor prediction accuracy and may be detrimental to the performance of the trained model.
