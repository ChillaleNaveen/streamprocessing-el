Microservices is a software development methodology that involves splitting applications into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other via RESTful APIs. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability in application design, as each service can be developed and deployed independently of other services. Additionally, microservices enable developers to maintain and update individual components more easily than a monolithic application, reducing downtime and improving overall application performance.
