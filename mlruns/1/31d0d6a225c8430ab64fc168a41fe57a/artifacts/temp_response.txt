Biodiversity refers to the diverse and complex relationships between organisms, including their interactions with one another at different levels of organization (from genes to entire ecosystems), in a given geographic area or environment. It is an important field of study that aims to understand how species interact with each other and the physical, chemical, and biological factors that contribute to their distribution, abundance, and behavior. Biodiversity also plays a crucial role in sustainable management and conservation of natural ecosystems.
