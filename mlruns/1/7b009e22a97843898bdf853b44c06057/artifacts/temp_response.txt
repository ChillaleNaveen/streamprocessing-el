Renewable energy refers to energy sources that can be replenished over time, such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. It is distinguished from non-renewable energy sources like coal, oil, and gas, which have finite resources that eventually need to be exploited or extracted. Renewables are often sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change.
