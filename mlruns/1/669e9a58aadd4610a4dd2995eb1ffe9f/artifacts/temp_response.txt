Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines. AI systems are designed to exhibit behaviors similar to human intelligence, allowing them to perform tasks that require reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In terms of specific applications, AI has been used in fields such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and manufacturing, among others. As the field continues to grow and evolve, AI will become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, transforming areas ranging from transportation to education, entertainment, and more.
