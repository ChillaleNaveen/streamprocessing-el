Biodiversity refers to the diverse range of living organisms, including animals and plants, in an ecosystem. It includes both single-celled and multicellular organisms, as well as different species within each group. This comprehensive understanding of the biodiversity of different ecosystems allows for a better understanding of the functioning and health of these systems.
