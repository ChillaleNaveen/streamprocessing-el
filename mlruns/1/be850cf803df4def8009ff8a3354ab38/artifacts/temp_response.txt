To read a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file in Python, follow these steps:

1. Open the .csv file with Python's built-in `open()` function:
   ```python
   import os
   
   # open the file as text
   with open("my_file.csv", "r") as csv_file:
       reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")
       
       for row in reader:
           # process each row of data here
           pass
    ```

2. Explore the contents of the CSV file:
   ```python
   with open("my_file.csv", "r") as csv_file:
       reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")
       
       for row in reader:
           # process each row of data here
           pass
    ```

3. Use a `csv` module's `read()` function to read the entire file into memory:
   ```python
   with open("my_file.csv", "r") as csv_file:
       reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")
       
       for row in reader:
           # process each row of data here
           pass
    ```

4. Check the contents of the CSV file using a `csv` module's `head()` or `tail()` functions:
   ```python
   with open("my_file.csv", "r") as csv_file:
       reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=",")
       
       for row in reader:
           # process each row of data here
           pass
    ```
