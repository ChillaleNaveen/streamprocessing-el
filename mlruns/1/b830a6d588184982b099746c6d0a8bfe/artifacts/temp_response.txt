Renewable Energy is an energy source derived from natural processes that have existed on Earth for millions of years. It refers to any form of energy that can be replenished or regenerated over time, such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. Renewable energy sources are considered sustainable and environmentally friendly because they do not emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, unlike non-renewable fossil fuels, which are finite resources that are quickly exhausted or depleted over time.
