Project management works by breaking down large-scale tasks or projects into smaller, more manageable parts that can be carried out by multiple team members. This process involves the following steps:

1. Devising a project plan: A detailed project plan is created to outline the goals, objectives, timeline, and scope of the project. It includes all necessary details such as stakeholders, resources required, deliverables, and milestones.

2. Establishing project milestones: Milestones are designated points within the project timeline where progress can be evaluated and goals achieved. These goals should align with the overall objectives of the project.

3. Assigning tasks and responsibilities: Each team member is assigned a task or responsibility that aligns with their skillset, experience, and expertise. This ensures that everyone involved in the project has a clear understanding of what needs to be done and when it will be completed.

4. Tracking progress: Progress is monitored through weekly meetings, sprints, or other methodologies agreed upon by the team. This helps identify any areas of improvement or progress that need to be made.

5. Continuous learning: The team should continuously learn and improve their skills throughout the project. This can be achieved through attending workshops, reading industry publications, and participating in online forums.

6. Reworking if necessary: In case of an unexpected obstacle or change in priorities, it is crucial to rework the project plan accordingly to ensure that the objectives are not lost.

By following these steps, a project can be completed efficiently and effectively, ensuring timely completion of goals while maintaining high-quality output.
