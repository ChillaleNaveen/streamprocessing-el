Market segmentation is the process of dividing the potential customers into distinct groups based on their common characteristics, preferences, and needs. It helps businesses to tailor their offerings to meet the specific needs and preferences of each segment, resulting in a more effective marketing strategy that can better target, engage, and convert these customers. By doing so, businesses can better understand their customers' pain points, preferences, and behavior, which allows them to develop products and services that are more likely to be successful with those groups.
