Cross-validation is an essential tool used in machine learning and statistical modeling to ensure generalizability, interpretability, and fairness of models. It involves splitting a dataset into two sets - the training set and the testing set - with one set designated as the training data and the other set as the testing data. The model is then trained on the entire training set and validated (tested) on the testing set. During this process, the model is iteratively adjusted based on the validation results to improve its predictive power and generalizability. This technique helps to avoid overfitting in the training set while ensuring that the model works well for both training and testing data.
