The greenhouse effect refers to a natural process where warm, earthy gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor trap heat near Earth's surface, trapping it inside our planet. This process helps maintain the temperature on Earth as it is surrounded by a layer of air that is warmer than its surroundings. In the absence of greenhouse gases, the Earth would have a much colder and darker atmosphere, leading to extreme weather conditions. However, due to the presence of these gases, the Earth's temperature is stable and regulated, allowing for life as we know it on our planet.
