To sort a list in Python, you can use the built-in sorted() function. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [2, 5, 8, 1, 3]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list) # Sort my_list in ascending order (descending is also possible by reversing the list using reversed())
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
