Generators in Python allow for the creation of iterable sequences without having to define an explicit loop or list comprehension. Generators are a powerful feature that is often used when working with large datasets, as it allows you to efficiently generate and process them. Here's how a generator function works:

1. Create a new function: To create a generator function in Python, follow these steps:

   ```python
   def function_name(*args, **kwargs):
       """
       Generates an iterable sequence using a generator function.
       
       Args:
           *args (optional): Passed to the function as positional arguments.
           **kwargs (optional): Keyword arguments that will be passed to the function.
       
       Returns:
           A generator object. The generator returns an iterable sequence in a lazy manner.
       
       """
   
       # Initialize the iterator
       for item in some_iterable:
           yield item
   ```

2. Define the function's parameters: In the above code, we have defined that our function takes two arguments (one positional argument and one keyword argument), and returns an iterator object. The `for` loop is executed once the generator object has been created, and each item in the sequence is yielded.

3. Use a generator expression: To create a generator expression instead of a function, follow these steps:

   ```python
   # Example use case: Generate an iterable sequence using a generator expression
   my_generator = (item for item in some_iterable)
   
   for item in my_generator:
       print(item)
   ```

In summary, generators are a powerful tool that allow for efficient data processing without the need for explicit loops or list comprehensions. They can be used to generate iterable sequences of elements without having to define a loop or comprehension.
