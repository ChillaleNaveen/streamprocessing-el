Blockchain technology works by using a decentralized and distributed ledger, which is known as the "blockchain." A blockchain is a public, immutable, and secure record of transactions that are secured and verified through cryptography. In order to create a new block on the blockchain, miners (computer users) must verify each previous block's validity using a complex mathematical algorithm called proof-of-work (PoW). This process ensures that no single entity or group has an unfair advantage over other users in terms of processing power and resources. Once a new block is created, it gets added to the blockchain, making it tamper-proof and immutable. The blockchain can be used for various applications, including digital identity verification, financial transactions, supply chain management, and voting. Additionally, blockchain technology can also help in creating secure and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
