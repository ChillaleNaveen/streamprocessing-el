Test-driven (TD) development is a software development methodology that involves writing functional and non-functional tests before developing a program. It's a process where developers write functional tests first, which help identify and fix bugs before moving onto writing the code to implement them. The goal of TD development is to ensure that the final product meets specified requirements and performs as expected.
