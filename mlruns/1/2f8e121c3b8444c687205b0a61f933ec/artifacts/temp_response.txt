To conduct a SWOT analysis, follow these steps:

1. Identify the Strengths (S) and Weaknesses (W), and then the Opportunities (O) and Threats (T).
2. For each strength and weakness, evaluate its positive or negative impact on the overall company performance.
3. Compare your current situation with your strategic plans to identify any gaps or opportunities for improvement.
4. Identify areas where you can focus on improving your position in the marketplace.
5. Define key objectives and targets, which should be aligned with your SWOT analysis and strategies.
6. Evaluate alternative scenarios based on different outcomes to determine the best course of action for the company.
