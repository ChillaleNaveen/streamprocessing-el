Cross-validation, also known as cross-fold or train-test split, is a method used in machine learning and statistical modeling to ensure that the results obtained from a given training set are not biased by the order of the data in the training set. In simple terms, it involves dividing the entire dataset into k separate subsets (also called folds) and assigning each subset to one of the two groups in the original dataset. The goal is to ensure that the results obtained from each group are comparable and not affected by the order in which they were trained on. Cross-validation can help identify model bias or overfitting, as it ensures that the training set has not been skewed with respect to any particular feature or variable. In practice, cross-validation is often used before performing a final evaluation on the dataset for final model selection and optimization.
