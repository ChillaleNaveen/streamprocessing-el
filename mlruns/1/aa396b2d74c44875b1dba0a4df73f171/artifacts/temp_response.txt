Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that uses mathematical models and algorithms to simulate intelligent behavior in digital systems. AI involves developing tools, software, and hardware that can mimic or emulate human-like problem-solving capabilities, decision-making skills, and communication abilities in the context of natural language, sensory input, and social interaction. It aims to create machines that are capable of understanding, learning, and adapting to complex tasks and situations. AI is an ongoing area of research and development with significant potential for impact on various sectors, including healthcare, education, transportation, finance, and manufacturing.
