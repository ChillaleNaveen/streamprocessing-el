Database Normalization is a fundamental concept in database design that aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of databases. It involves creating relational tables with consistent and unique schema (structure) for data entities. This ensures that data can be easily retrieved, modified, and deleted efficiently. By normalizing databases, we can minimize the number of joins required between table relationships to optimize performance and reduce database access time.
