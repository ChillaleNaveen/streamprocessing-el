The main distinction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) lies in their approaches to automating decision-making processes. AI is an approach that utilizes algorithms, statistical models, and data analytics to simulate intelligent behavior or learn from past experiences. ML on the other hand is focused on developing algorithms that can learn from data, allowing for the creation of self-improving systems that can generalize and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

In summary, AI focuses on developing algorithms that can perform complex tasks through the use of machine or neural networks, while ML develops models based on data that learn to predict outcomes from past experiences or patterns in data. The key difference between these two approaches is their approach to self-learning and problem-solving.
