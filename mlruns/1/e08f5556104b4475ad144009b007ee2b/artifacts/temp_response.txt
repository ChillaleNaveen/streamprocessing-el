Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a type of machine learning that allows machines to learn and perform tasks without being explicitly programmed. It involves using algorithms and computational models to replicate human-like cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and emotion recognition. AI can be used in various fields like healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, and more, enabling machines to perform complex tasks that were previously solely the domain of humans.
