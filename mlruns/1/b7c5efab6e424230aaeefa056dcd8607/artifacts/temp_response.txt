Project management works by breaking down larger projects into smaller, more manageable parts. This process involves defining goals and objectives, creating a project plan, assigning tasks to team members, monitoring progress, resolving issues as they arise, and ultimately delivering the project on time and within budget. The project manager coordinates and delegates tasks, ensures that resources are allocated appropriately, and tracks progress towards achieving project goals. By implementing effective project management techniques, such as planning, communication, delegation, risk management, and timely completion of tasks, project success can be achieved.
