Biodiversity refers to the variety and abundance of organisms that exist within a given ecosystem. It encompasses a broad range of living things, including fungi, plants, animals, and microorganisms, all living together in a particular environment or habitat. This diverse variety of organisms is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems, providing food, and generating biological energy through photosynthesis.
