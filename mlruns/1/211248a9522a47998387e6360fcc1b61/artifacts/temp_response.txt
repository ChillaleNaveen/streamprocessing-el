A/B Testing is a strategy in which two versions of a website or product are tested to determine which one performs better. This process allows companies to optimize their content, layouts, and messaging for maximum conversion rates and customer engagement. The goal is to choose the most effective version for each user based on their behavior, interests, and preferences. A/B testing can lead to significant improvements in user experience, conversions, and revenue.
