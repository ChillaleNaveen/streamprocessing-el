Sure! Here are some creative and informative ways to explain algorithmic concepts:

1. Simplify the algorithm: Instead of using complex mathematical notation, try breaking down the algorithm into smaller parts that can be explained easily. For instance, if you're learning the binary search algorithm, try explaining it as a series of steps like "find the middle number in the list," "check if the middle number is greater than or equal to the first or second middle number," and so on.

2. Use visuals: Consider using diagrams, graphs, or visual aids such as flowcharts, pie charts, or bar charts to illustrate how different steps of the algorithm work together. This can help clarify complex concepts and make them easier to understand for anyone who's not an expert in computer science.

3. Use analogies: Instead of using abstract terms like "algorithmic complexity" or "branching factor," try using real-life analogies, such as describing the algorithm as a journey with different branches and decisions that need to be taken along the way. This can help people who are not familiar with technical jargon to understand.

4. Make it interactive: You could also make the explanation interactive by inviting participants or viewers to try out the algorithm themselves. For example, you could create a video tutorial where someone guides you through each step of the algorithm and provides explanations as they go along. This can help people who are just starting with an algorithmic concept to practice applying it in real-life scenarios.

5. Use humor: If you're teaching a complex algorithm, try using humorous examples or anecdotes to make it more relatable and enjoyable for viewers. For example, if you're teaching the binary search algorithm, you could use a joke like "binary search is like trying to find a needle in a haystack - it only works if you have a lot of room!"
