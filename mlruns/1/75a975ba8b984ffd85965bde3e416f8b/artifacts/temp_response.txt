Sure! Lambda functions are a type of serverless computing function in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that can run directly on the AWS cloud without requiring an EC2 instance. They are built to handle the complexities of running large-scale applications and provide a low latency, scalable, and cost-effective solution for handling data and processing tasks. Lambda functions can be triggered by various events such as API calls, SNS messages, or CloudWatch Events, and they perform their task in a highly efficient way without requiring any user interaction. This makes them an excellent choice for handling heavy traffic, repetitive workloads, and complex processes.
