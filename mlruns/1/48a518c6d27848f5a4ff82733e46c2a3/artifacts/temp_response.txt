Overfitting is a problem in machine learning where model training becomes too focused on data that was not used during training. This is typically identified when the model performs poorly or struggles to generalize to new data, indicating that it has been trained on too much data and needs to be retrained with less. In essence, overfitting occurs when a model's learning algorithm becomes too specific to the training data, leading to a decrease in performance on unseen data. By limiting the amount of data used for training, overfitting can be mitigated and better generalization can be achieved.
