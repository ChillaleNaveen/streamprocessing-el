Lean methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes continuous improvement and reduced waste in order to deliver high-quality products or services while minimizing costs and maximizing value for customers. It was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation, which has become a worldwide leader in manufacturing efficiency and sustainability. The lean methodology involves a systematic approach to reducing costs, increasing productivity, improving quality, and streamlining processes, with the goal of creating value for stakeholders while minimizing waste. By following the principles of Kaizen (continuous improvement), TPM (total productive maintenance) and 5S (standards for a clean workplace), lean methodology helps organizations to achieve their objectives more efficiently and effectively.
