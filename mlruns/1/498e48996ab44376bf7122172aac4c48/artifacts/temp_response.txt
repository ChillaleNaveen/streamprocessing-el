Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, which refers to the tendency of models trained on small amounts of data to overfit or "fit" only to the training data. This can lead to poor generalization capabilities and may cause the model to make predictions that are not reflective of the true distribution of data. To avoid overfitting, it is necessary to balance the training set with additional data from different sources. This process is known as cross-validation or stratified sampling.
