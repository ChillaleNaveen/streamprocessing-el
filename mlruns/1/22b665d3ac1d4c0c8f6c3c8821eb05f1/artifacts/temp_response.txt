Renewable Energy is the use of energy that is naturally replenished every day, such as sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass (plant or animal matter). It is also referred to as sustainable energy. Renewable energy sources have no finite supply, making them an essential source of energy for the future.
