Containerization is an approach to software development that involves packaging applications and their dependencies (software components) into small, self-contained containers. This approach simplifies the process of running and managing the application in a virtualized environment while providing a uniform interface for developers and operators. Docker is a container management platform that allows for the creation, deployment, and management of containers on various platforms, including Linux and Windows.

In containerization, the application code and any necessary libraries or dependencies are packaged into a single container image. This image includes everything required to run the application with its dependencies (such as databases, libraries, and other application components) along with any system requirements needed for execution. When running containers, developers can focus on writing their code without needing to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure or software stack.

Docker allows developers to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications on a variety of platforms using a simple command line interface (CLI). This approach simplifies the process of testing, debugging, and deploying applications, as well as reducing the risk of system failures due to incompatibilities between different components.

In summary, containerization is a software development technique that simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and managing software applications by creating self-contained containers that contain all necessary dependencies and code. Docker is a container management platform that enables developers to create, deploy, and manage containerized applications on various platforms.
