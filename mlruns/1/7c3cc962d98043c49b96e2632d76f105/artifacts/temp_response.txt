To use regular expressions in Python, follow these steps:

1. Import the re module by running the following code in a Python interpreter:
   ```python
   import re
   ```

2. To create a regular expression pattern from a string, you can use the r"pattern string"` syntax:
   ```python
   my_regex = re.compile(r"pattern string")
   ```

3. To match patterns within a string using the `re` module, you can use the `search()` method with the pattern and the string as arguments:
   ```python
   if my_regex.search("some string").group() == "some string":
       print("Pattern matches")
   else:
       print("Pattern does not match")
   ```

4. To replace patterns within a string, you can use the `sub()` method with a replacement string and a regular expression pattern:
   ```python
   new_string = my_regex.sub(r"replacement string", "some string")
   ```

5. To find all occurrences of patterns in a string using the `findall()` method, you can specify a re.DOTALL flag to match any character instead of just newline characters:
   ```python
   my_patterns = []
   for match in re.findall(r"my pattern", my_string):
       my_patterns.append(match)
   ```
