Sure, here's a function that finds duplicates in a list:

```python
def find_duplicates(lst):
    # Initialize a set to store duplicate elements
    duplicate_set = set()
    
    # Loop through the list and check if each element has not already been added to the set
    for item in lst:
        if item in duplicate_set:
            continue  # If the item is already in the set, skip it
        
        # Add the item to the set if it's not already present
        duplicate_set.add(item)
    
    return duplicate_set
```

In this function, we create a `set` object called `duplicate_set` to store duplicate elements. We initialize it with an empty set (`set()`) and then loop through the list `lst`, checking if each element is already in the `duplicate_set`. If it's already in the set, we skip it (continue) since we don't need to add it again. Once we've added all unique elements to the `duplicate_set`, we return the set.
