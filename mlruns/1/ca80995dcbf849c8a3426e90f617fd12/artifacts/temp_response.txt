Lambda functions are an integral part of the AWS Lambda serverless computing platform and are a powerful tool for writing reusable, highly scalable, and efficient code. A lambda function is a serverless application that is triggered by an event such as a HTTP request or SQS message. It runs in the cloud on behalf of the user and returns the desired output based on the input received. Lambda functions are designed to be small, lightweight, and easy to deploy. They have built-in security features, caching, and other performance optimization techniques that make them ideal for serverless computing.
