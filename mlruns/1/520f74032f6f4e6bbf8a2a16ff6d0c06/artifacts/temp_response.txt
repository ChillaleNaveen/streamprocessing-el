Sure, I'd be happy to explain machine learning in simple terms! Machine learning is a powerful tool that allows computers and machines (also known as machines or robots) to learn from data without being programmed to do so. In machine learning, a problem is defined, and a dataset of data is provided. The algorithm then learns from the data using statistical models or algorithms, which can make predictions based on the data. This process is repeated until the model achieves high accuracy (usually with some margin) in predicting new data based on the training dataset. By doing so, machine learning can help computers or machines solve problems that were previously difficult for them to do.
