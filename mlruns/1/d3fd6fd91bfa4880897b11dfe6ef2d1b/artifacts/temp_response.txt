Overfitting in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where an algorithm or model trained on a small dataset may become too confident in its predictions and stop improving or generalizing well beyond that training data set. In other words, overfitting occurs when a model has been trained with a limited amount of labeled data and starts to rely heavily on that data to make accurate predictions on new, unlabeled data. This can result in the model being less robust and less able to generalize to unseen data. Therefore, it is essential to carefully choose and balance the size and type of training data with the goal of achieving optimal generalization performance.
