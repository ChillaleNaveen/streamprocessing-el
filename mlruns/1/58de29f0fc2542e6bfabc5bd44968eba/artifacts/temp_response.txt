To sort a list in Python, you can use the built-in sorted() function or one of its subclasses. Here's how to sort a list using the sorted() function:

```python
# Example input and output for sorted() function
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
print("Sorted list:", lst) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this example, we create a list `lst` with elements between 1 and 5 inclusive. We then sort the list using the sorted() function to return the corresponding sorted list, which is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

To sort in descending order, pass the keyword argument "reverse=True" when calling the sorted() method:

```python
# Example input and output for sorted() with reverse=True function
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True) # Sort in descending order
print("Sorted list with reverse sort:", lst) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

In this example, we create a list with elements between 1 and 5 inclusive. We then sort the list using the sorted() function with the "reverse=True" keyword argument to reverse the order of the elements. The resulting sorted list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
