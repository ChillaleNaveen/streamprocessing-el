Analogy: Neural Networks are like a living organism that processes and transmits information within its structure, similar to how the human brain works. Unlike our brains, however, neural networks have no physical structure or body, but instead contain computational processing units (or neurons) connected by synaptic connections. This analogical relationship between the brain and neural networks is based on the fact that these two systems are both designed to process information in a logical and coherent manner, which leads to our understanding of how they work together.
