Renewable Energy refers to the use of natural resources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass that are replenished over time through natural processes. This type of energy is sustainable because it can be replenished without depleting the planet's resources for future generations. Renewable energy sources offer a cleaner, more eco-friendly alternative to non-renewable fossil fuels that can contribute to global warming and climate change.
