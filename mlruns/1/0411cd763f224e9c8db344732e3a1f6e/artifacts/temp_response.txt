To measure customer satisfaction, AI-powered customer experience (CX) solutions typically use surveys, feedback forms, and other interactive tools that collect data on customer experiences. This data can then be analyzed to identify patterns and trends, which can help companies better understand their customers' needs, preferences, and overall satisfaction levels. Additionally, AI-powered CX solutions can provide real-time insights into customer satisfaction using automated reporting and analytics tools that can inform decision-making, improve process efficiency, and optimize service delivery.
