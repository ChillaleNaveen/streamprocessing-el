Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae and certain bacteria use sunlight (photons) to generate chemical energy (chemicals called ATP or adenosine triphosphate) through a series of reactions. This process occurs in two ways: red light, which is present in the majority of light sources, generates a proton gradient that enables protons to move from the light-absorbing chlorophyll molecule (a pigment found in plants and algae) to the oxygen-producing enzyme complex known as the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which then produces ATP. Green light, which is less abundant than red light but still present in many plant leaves, provides a second source of light that can enhance photosynthesis by driving an additional process called Calvin cycle. In this process, oxygen gas (O2) is produced and the electron transport chain converts O2 into water molecules (H2O), which are then released back into the soil or used as a source of energy for plants. This process occurs at night when photosynthesis is inactive due to darkness, but also during daylight hours where photons are present.
