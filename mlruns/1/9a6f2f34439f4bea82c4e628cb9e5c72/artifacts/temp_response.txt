Machine learning is a field that involves the use of algorithms and data to learn from and improve upon its own patterns and behavior, based on historical data. In simpler terms, machine learning is like "learning" through experience or observation. It has several applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, retail, and many more. Machine learning algorithms can be programmed to take inputs, analyze them, and make predictions or decisions based on the existing data. They help companies and organizations make better decisions by improving their decision-making processes, leading to increased efficiency and profitability.
