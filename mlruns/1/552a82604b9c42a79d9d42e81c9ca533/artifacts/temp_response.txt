Both append() and extend() are methods of string objects in Python that allow you to add or replace characters at specific positions within a string. Here's a brief explanation of each method:

1. Append(): This method appends a new string object to the end of an existing string, as shown in the following example:

```python
my_string = 'hello, world!'
new_str = my_string + '! Hello World'
print(new_str) # Output: hello, world! hello, world!
```

In this example, we append the string "! Hello World" to the end of our initial string "hello, world!" using the append() method. The resulting string is "hello, world! hi, world!"

2. Extend(): This method extends a string object by appending additional characters at the end, as shown in the following example:

```python
my_string = 'Hello, World!'
new_str = my_string + '!'
print(new_str) # Output: Hello, World! ! Hello, World!
```

In this example, we extend our initial string "Hello, World!" by appending the character "!" at the end. The resulting string is "Hello, World! ! Hello, World!"

These methods allow you to add or replace characters at specific positions within a string without modifying the entire string object itself. You can also use these methods with built-in strings like "string" and "list", as shown in this example:

```python
my_list = ['Hello', 'World!']
my_str = my_list[1] + '!'
print(my_str) # Output: Hello, World! !
```
