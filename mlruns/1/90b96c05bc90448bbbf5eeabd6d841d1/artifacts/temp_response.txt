Renewable energy is any type of energy that is generated from natural or man-made sources, such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. It provides a sustainable source of energy that can be used to power homes, businesses, and industries while reducing the reliance on non-renewable fuels like oil, gas, and coal. Renewable energy sources are considered clean and environmentally friendly since they produce no pollutants or greenhouse gases, making them an essential part of a sustainable future.
