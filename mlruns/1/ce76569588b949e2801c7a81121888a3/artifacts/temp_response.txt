Pyton generators, also called lazy evaluations or partial evaluation, are a type of function that runs only when needed. They work by returning a value based on the input, and they can be used in conjunction with loops and conditional statements to optimize code. In Python, a generator object is created by calling the "next" method, which returns the next item in a generator. This method allows the function to return multiple items at once, without having to evaluate them all upfront. The resulting generator object can then be iterated over using the "for ... in" or "itertools.chain.*" syntax. Generators are useful when you want to use a loop or conditional statement only for specific conditions, and they allow for more efficient code execution.
