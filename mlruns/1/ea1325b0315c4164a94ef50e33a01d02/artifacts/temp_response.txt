Biodiversity is the study of the diversity and abundance of organisms within a specific ecosystem, including their species composition, biomass, physiological traits, and interactions with each other and the environment. It involves an interdisciplinary approach that combines ecology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and other sciences to understand how this diverse population of organisms interacts and adapts to their surroundings.
