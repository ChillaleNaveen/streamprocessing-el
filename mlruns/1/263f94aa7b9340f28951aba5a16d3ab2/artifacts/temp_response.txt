Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning and statistical modeling to evaluate the performance of a classification or regression model in a split of the data set. The process involves dividing the entire dataset into two groups, and using one group as the training set and the other as the testing set. This allows for accurate evaluation of the performance of the model on unseen data and helps identify any potential issues with the model's generalization abilities. Cross-validation is a common tool in the development of machine learning models and has been used in various applications such as healthcare, finance, and marketing.
