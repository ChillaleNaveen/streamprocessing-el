Market segmentation is a process of dividing customers into groups based on their specific needs, wants, and behaviors. It helps businesses identify and target customers who have the most significant potential for growth and profitability, thus optimizing marketing and sales efforts. By understanding and categorizing customer demographics and psychographic profiles, companies can tailor their messaging, products, and services to meet the specific needs of each segment.
