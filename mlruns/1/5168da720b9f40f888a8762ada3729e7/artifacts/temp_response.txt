Overfitting, also known as overfitting or over-training, is a type of machine learning where the training data and model are too similar to the real underlying data. This means that the model has not learned any useful information from the training data, but instead has focused on repeating patterns in the data. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization performance, or the ability of the model to generalize well to new data, which is why it is important to prevent overfitting by varying the training data and/or adjusting the model's hyperparameters.
