A "helper" is a kind of helpful AI system that provides users with specific, task-specific functions or services. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an intermediary between applications and the internet. Analogies are often used to help illustrate complex concepts in simpler terms. In this case, APIs can be seen as analogous to helper systems, which provide specific tasks or functions for humans to complete. Like a helper system, APIs have their own unique features and capabilities that allow them to perform these tasks efficiently and effectively. However, the specific tasks they are designed to carry out may vary depending on the application's specific needs and requirements.
