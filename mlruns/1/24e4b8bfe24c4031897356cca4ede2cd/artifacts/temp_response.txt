Sure! Lambda functions are a type of built-in AWS service that provides a flexible way to define and execute serverless APIs in AWS. They allow you to build serverless applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure or code, making it easy for developers to focus on building their applications instead of worrying about setting up and managing servers. Lambda functions can be used in combination with other AWS services, such as Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrent Requests (PCR), to build robust serverless applications that can handle high volumes of requests without the need for additional infrastructure.
