Supply chain management is a process of managing the flow of goods, services, and resources within an organization to ensure their availability and delivery in a timely and efficient manner. It involves planning, coordinating, and controlling the entire supply chain from raw materials sourcing to delivery to end-users. This process ensures that products are available when needed, that inventory levels are maintained, and that costs are optimized for maximum profitability.
