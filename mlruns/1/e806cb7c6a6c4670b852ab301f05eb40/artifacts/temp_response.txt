Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are not limited by traditional resources such as oil, coal, and gas. It can be harvested from renewable sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and bioenergy, which do not depend on fossil fuels or other non-renewable resources. Renewables, therefore, offer a sustainable source of energy that is environmentally friendly and can help mitigate the effects of climate change.
