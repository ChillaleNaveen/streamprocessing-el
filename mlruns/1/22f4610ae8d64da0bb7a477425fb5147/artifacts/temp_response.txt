Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks. In simpler terms, machine learning enables machines to “think” like humans by analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data in order to make decisions based on patterns and trends.

Machine learning is a continually evolving field with new applications being discovered every day. Some common uses for machine learning include predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and search engine optimization (SEO). By analyzing historical data, machines can learn patterns and make predictions about future events, which in turn helps businesses optimize their operations and generate revenue.

In summary, machine learning is the process of teaching computers to "think" like humans by analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data using artificial intelligence techniques.
