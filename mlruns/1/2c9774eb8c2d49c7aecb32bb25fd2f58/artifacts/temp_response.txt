Renewable energy refers to sources of electricity that are derived from natural, non-depletable resources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass. These sources are constantly replenished and can be harnessed indefinitely without the need for additional inputs, such as oil or gas. Renewable energy is an alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based electricity generation, which has a finite lifespan and produces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. It has become increasingly popular over the past few decades due to its environmental, economic, and social benefits.
