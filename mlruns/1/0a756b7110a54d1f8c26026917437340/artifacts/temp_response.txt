The main difference between append and extend in Python is that appends appends new values to an existing list, while extends extends a list by inserting new elements at the end. Here's an example:

```python
# Example 1: Appending new values to a list
a = [1, 2, 3]
a += [4, 5]
print(a)

# Example 2: Extending a list by appending new elements at the end
b = [1, 2]
b.extend([3, 4])
print(b)
```

In Example 1, we append 4 and 5 to an existing list `[1, 2, 3]`. In Example 2, we extend the list with these new values by appending them at the end.
