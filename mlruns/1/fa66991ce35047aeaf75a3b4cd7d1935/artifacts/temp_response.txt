Renewable energy refers to sources of energy that are naturally replenished and can be harnessed repeatedly without depleting their resources. This includes energy derived from sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, biomass (such as wood chips), and even some forms of nuclear energy such as thorium reactors. Renewable energy sources have the advantage of being sustainable and non-renewable natural resources that can be used indefinitely without causing environmental damage or depleting their reserves.
