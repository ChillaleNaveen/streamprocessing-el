A Python generator is a specialized iterable object that can generate multiple items using an infinite loop or a fixed number of steps. Generators are used to make complex computations more efficient, especially when working with large amounts of data. In essence, they allow for a more concise and efficient way to process large datasets.

Here's how a generator works:

1. Create a generator object:

```python
def f():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
    yield 4
```

2. Call the `next()` method on the generator:

```python
for num in g:
    print(num)
```

This will output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

3. Use a generator to process large datasets:

```python
from itertools import repeat

def g():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
    yield 4
    yield 5
    yield 6
    yield 7
    yield 8
    yield 9
    yield 10
```

This will output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

In summary, generators in Python are an effective way to process large datasets efficiently. They allow for a more concise and efficient way to generate data without using multiple loops or functions.
