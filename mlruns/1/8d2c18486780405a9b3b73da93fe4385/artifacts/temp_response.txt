Renewable Energy refers to energy sources that can be replenished without depleting their reserves. It includes energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and biomass, which are sustainable in nature and do not require external fossil fuels or non-renewable resources for their production. Renewable energy is considered to be an essential tool for a sustainable future since it reduces the dependence on finite resources like oil, coal, and gas, which can eventually lead to their depletion or price increases.
