The water cycle is a complex and intricate process that involves the flow, movement, and transformation of water between different entities in nature such as land, sea, air, and rocks. The water cycle can be broken down into four main stages:

1. Atmospheric Water Cycle: This stage occurs in the atmosphere where water vapor is formed from thecombustion of gases (such as carbon dioxide) or through precipitation from rain or snow. During this process, water vapor condenses to form clouds and eventually falls back down into the atmosphere as rain or snow.

2. Terrestrial Water Cycle: This stage occurs on land where water is absorbed by plants, evaporated in the hot sun, and then replenished by rainfall or melting snow/ice. In some areas, like deserts, water can be stored underground for later use during periods of drought.

3. Oceanic Water Cycle: This stage occurs in oceans where water is transported from land to the sea through rivers, rain, and wind. The ocean absorbs vast amounts of freshwater each year due to the melting ice caps and glaciers of the polar regions.

4. Subsurface Water Cycle: This stage occurs below the Earth's surface, where water is found in lakes, rivers, and underground aquifers. The cycle of water movement and storage changes with the seasons and weather patterns. For example, during summer months when there is more evaporation, the subsurface water table can rise.

Together, these four stages make up a complex and interconnected system that supports life on Earth. Water is essential for life as we know it, from plants to animals to humans. Without water, life would be impossible!
