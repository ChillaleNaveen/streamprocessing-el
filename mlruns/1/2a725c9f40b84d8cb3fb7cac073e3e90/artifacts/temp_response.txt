Sure! A lambda function is a type of programming construct in the context of functional programming languages like Haskell and Elm, where it defines a function without any parameters. It can be used to perform computations or perform actions based on specific conditions or criteria. Here's an example:

```haskell
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y
```

In this function, `x` and `y` are the arguments that will be passed to the function, and `+` is the operation used on those arguments. In this context, it's equivalent to using a "lambda" operator to define a function without any parameters.
