Both append and extend are built-in methods for adding items to a list or tuple in Python, respectively. Here's how they differ:

1. Append (list) - Appends an element(s) to the end of a list.

Examples:

```python
# Appending an element at the end of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Adding multiple elements to a list
my_list = []
for I in range(5):
    my_list.append(i+1)
print(my_list) # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the append method appends an element to the end of the list `my_list`. The extended method (extend) adds all the elements in a list `lst` to another list `new_list`, using the `append` method. Here's how it works:

1. Extend (tuple) - Extends an existing tuple with a new element(s).

Examples:

```python
# Extending a tuple with a new element(s)
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
new_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)
print(new_tuple) # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

In this example, the extended method appends all elements in a tuple `my_tuple` to another tuple named `new_tuple`. The output will be `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`.
