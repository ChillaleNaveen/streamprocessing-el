Lambda functions are a programming construct in AWS Lambda that allow you to define and execute code asynchronously. They run on AWS's dedicated servers and are ideal for tasks that require high availability, concurrency or scalability. They can be used with AWS services such as DynamoDB, S3, Elasticsearch, and API Gateway, among others. Lambda functions are designed to be lightweight, easy to deploy, and cost-efficient.
