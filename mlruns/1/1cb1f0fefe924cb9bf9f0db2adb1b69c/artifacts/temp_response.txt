Yes, here's a solution for finding duplicates in a list using Python. Here's an example usage and function signature:

```python
def get_duplicates(lst):
    """
    Returns a list of duplicate elements from the provided list.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): The list containing duplicates to search for.
        
    Returns:
        A new list with all unique elements.
    """
    return [x for x in lst if x not in set(lst)]  # Remove duplicate elements and only keep unique ones
```

Here's how to use it:

```python
>>> my_list = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange", "apple"]
>>> duplicates = get_duplicates(my_list)  # Get duplicates from the list using the function above
>>> print(duplicates)  # Print the unique elements from the list with duplicates removed
['apple']
```
