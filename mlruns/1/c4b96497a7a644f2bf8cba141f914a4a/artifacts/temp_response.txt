Machine Learning (ML) is an approach to artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques and algorithms to learn from data and improve its predictions or outcomes based on past experiences. It has become a popular tool for various industries, including healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and more. In essence, it involves the use of algorithms that analyze large amounts of data to make decisions and recommendations based on historical trends, patterns, and customer behavior. By applying these insights, ML is able to improve business outcomes in areas such as product development, marketing campaigns, and customer service. In summary, machine learning is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting human behavior and improving business outcomes through data-driven decision making.
