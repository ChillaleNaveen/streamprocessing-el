ROI (Return on Investment) is a financial metric that measures the profitability of an investment relative to its initial cost. It is typically calculated as the difference between the net income generated by the business after deducting all expenses, including capital expenditures, interest payments, and taxes, divided by the original amount invested.

ROI helps organizations understand the return on their investment in a particular project or initiative, which can help them make informed decisions about how to allocate resources and prioritize projects. It can also be used to measure the success of various strategies and initiatives over time, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of an organization's operations and decision-making processes.
