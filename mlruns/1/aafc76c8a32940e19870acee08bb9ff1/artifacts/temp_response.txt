A Return on Investment (ROI) is a measure of the profitability or financial return generated by an investment, compared to its initial cost and time investment. It measures the amount of money generated by an investment after subtracting its associated costs, including any interest or fees, from its original value or net asset value (NAV). ROI calculation is based on a fixed period (usually one year) over which the profitability of the investment is assessed. The goal of ROI calculation is to determine how well an investment has performed and whether it should be continued or withdrawn from the investment portfolio.
