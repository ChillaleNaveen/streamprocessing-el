Cross-validation is a commonly used technique in statistics, machine learning, and other fields that involves splitting a dataset into training and testing sets. In cross-validation, the training set is used to fit a model or make predictions on a different portion of the data called the testing set. The aim is to evaluate the model's performance on the unseen data, which is known as the held-out data, in order to determine whether the model generalizes well to unseen data. This technique can help improve the accuracy and precision of predictions by ensuring that the model does not overfit or misclassify new data.
