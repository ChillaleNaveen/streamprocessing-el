Classification and Regression are two different types of machine learning algorithms that aim to predict or classify data based on specific features or variables. Classification is a decision-making process wherein objects are categorized into groups based on their characteristics, and the goal is to assign each object into one of predefined categories. In contrast, regression is an approach for finding relationships between dependent and independent variables, which can help predict outcomes or generate insights from data.

Classification algorithms use binary classification wherein objects are either labeled as belonging to a specific category or not, while Regression algorithms aim to forecast outcomes based on a set of inputs. These algorithms differ in the level of granularity and complexity required for the task at hand. Classification algorithms typically require more data points or features to accurately predict outcomes while regression models require fewer input variables or conditions.

In summary, classification and regression are distinct but complementary approaches for machine learning, with classification focusing on predicting specific outcomes and regression on modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables.
