Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software development methodology that focuses on designing and implementing programs that have objects as their fundamental units of organization. OOP provides a structure for developing software by dividing it into modules, classes, and instances. Objects are abstract data types that represent real-world entities, such as people, plants, or machines, in a computer program. In OOP, classes contain attributes (such as characteristics, properties, or behaviors) and methods that define the functions of an object. Instances of objects are created by calling methods within their class. Each instance has its own unique set of attributes and behaviors. By following these principles, developers can create complex and robust software programs with easy-to-understand interfaces and efficient code.
