Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that allows machines to simulate and replicate human behavior, reasoning, and intelligence. It involves the development of systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and solving problems like humans do. AI systems can perform complex tasks such as decision making, problem-solving, and learning from data. The technology has numerous applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and entertainment.
