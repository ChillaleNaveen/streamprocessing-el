Overfitting in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where a model or algorithm is trained on a dataset that is not representative of the data distribution in the real world. This can lead to underfitting, which is when the model performs poorly on new datasets, or overfitting, which is when the model learns patterns and assumptions that are specific to the training set but may not generalize well to other data. Overfitting can arise due to various factors such as the size of the dataset being too small for effective training or the complexity of the problem being too complicated for simple techniques to handle. This can be mitigated by using appropriate hyperparameters, regularization techniques, and early stopping strategies in machine learning algorithms to ensure that the model does not overfit its training set.
