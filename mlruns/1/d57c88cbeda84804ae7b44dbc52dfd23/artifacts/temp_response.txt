Sure! Lambda functions are a type of serverless function in AWS that is designed to run asynchronously and is optimized for low latency, high throughput, and scalability. They are available on AWS's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and its Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), making it easier for developers to build and deploy their applications quickly and efficiently. Lambda functions can be triggered by events such as API calls or S3 object events, and they run in the AWS cloud environment, eliminating the need for a virtual machine or server. They are designed to perform tasks that require low-latency and high throughput, such as processing large amounts of data, performing complex calculations, or handling heavy loads.
