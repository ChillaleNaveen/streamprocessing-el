Market segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on their specific needs, interests, and behaviors. This helps businesses understand which products or services are most likely to appeal to each segment and optimize their sales and marketing efforts accordingly. It also helps them tailor their messaging and offers to better meet the needs and preferences of each group. In other words, market segmentation is an essential tool for building customer loyalty and maximizing revenue growth.
