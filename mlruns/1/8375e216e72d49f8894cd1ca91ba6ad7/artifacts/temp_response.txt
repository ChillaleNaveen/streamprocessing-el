Sure! Here's a Python function that finds duplicates in a list:

```python
def duplicate_remover(lst):
    """
    This function removes duplicates from a list by iterating over the list and keeping only the first occurrence of each unique value.
    
    Args:
        lst (list): The list to be filtered for duplicates
        
    Returns:
        list: A new list containing all unique elements in sorted order
    """
    
    seen = set()  # Create a set to store the unique values
    
    for x in lst:
        if x not in seen:  # If the current element is not already seen, add it to the set
            seen.add(x)
        
    return sorted([x for x in lst if x not in seen])  # Sort the list with the unique elements at the end
```

This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing all unique elements in sorted order. It uses a set to store the unique values, and iterates over the list while keeping only the first occurrence of each value that's not already in the set.
