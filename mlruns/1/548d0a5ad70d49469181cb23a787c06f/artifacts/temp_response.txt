Project management works by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable goals or objectives. These objectives are then assigned to specific team members and broken down into more detailed tasks that are also assigned to specific team members. The process involves tracking progress, assigning resources (such as time, money, or people), monitoring deadlines, and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the overall project goal. Through this coordinated effort, project managers can ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and meet all necessary quality standards.
