Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent systems based on mathematical models and algorithms. AI systems are capable of performing tasks that were once solely the domain of humans, such as decision-making, reasoning, problem-solving, self-learning, and communication with humans or other machines. In essence, AI represents a vastly advanced form of computing that has revolutionized various industries, including healthcare, transportation, finance, education, and logistics.
