Database Normalization is a process of designing and maintaining data tables in such a way that they are more manageable, consistent, and easier to maintain. It involves breaking down complex relationships between data elements into simpler, more logical entities. This helps to reduce the risks associated with database errors, improves query performance and reduces the number of redundant fields. Database Normalization ensures that data is stored correctly and is not exposed to any potential security risks or system-wide disasters. It helps to maintain consistency and prevent data corruption in a database.
