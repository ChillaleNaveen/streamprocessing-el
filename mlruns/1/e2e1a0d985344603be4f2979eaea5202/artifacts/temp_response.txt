A/B Testing is a digital marketing technique that involves testing different variations of a single page or web form to see which one performs better in terms of conversions, engagement, and revenue. It is used to determine which version of the product or service would be most beneficial for the target audience based on their preferences, needs, and behaviors. A/B testing helps to identify which elements of a website or campaign are working and which ones need improvement, ultimately leading to a more effective marketing strategy.
