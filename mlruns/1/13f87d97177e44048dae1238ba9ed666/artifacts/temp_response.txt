Renewable energy refers to sources of energy that can be replenished, such as wind or solar power, and are considered sustainable because they do not require a finite source of resources. In contrast, non-renewable energy sources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are limited in their ability to provide energy over time, making them unsuitable for long-term use in the face of increasing demand for electricity, transportation, and other industrial activities.
