Supply chain management (SCM) refers to the process of managing the flow of goods, services, and resources from suppliers to customers in an organized and efficient manner. It is an integral part of any organization's business strategy that ensures that products are available when and where they are needed, at the right price, and with the right quality. SCM involves a range of processes such as procurement, inventory management, logistics, transportation, warehousing, and delivery. It helps organizations to maintain a seamless supply chain, avoid costly delays, improve customer service, and enhance overall business performance.
