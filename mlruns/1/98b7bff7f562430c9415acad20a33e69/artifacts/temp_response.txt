A/B Testing is a method used to evaluate and optimize different variations of an offer or promotion for better results. It allows businesses to test their ads, landing pages, or other marketing materials against two or more conditions to determine which one performs best. This process can help businesses identify what works best for their audience and optimize their marketing efforts accordingly.
