Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a class of machines that can simulate intelligent behavior and perform tasks in complex ways. It involves the development of systems that can learn, reason, and make decisions based on data input and external inputs. AI has revolutionized many industries, from finance and medicine to transportation and education, by providing advanced computational capabilities for solving complex problems and enabling human-machine interaction.
