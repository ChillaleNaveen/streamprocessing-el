To handle exceptions in Python, you can use try-except statements and raise statements. Here's an example:

```python
try:
    # code that may throw an exception
except Exception as e:
    # catch the exception and log it or print a message
    print(f"Exception caught: {e}")
else:
    # if no exceptions are thrown, this block of code will be executed
```

This code defines a try-except block with two statements. The first statement tries to run the code inside a try block, but an exception is caught and logged or printed in case of an exception. If there are no exceptions, the second statement executes without any blocks of code. 

In this example, we're catching a `KeyError` exception that occurred when trying to access a dictionary key with an invalid key. By defining the try-except block, we're catching exceptions and log them or printing messages before executing the code inside the try block.
