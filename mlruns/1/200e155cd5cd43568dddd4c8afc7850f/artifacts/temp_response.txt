Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software development approach that emphasizes the use of classes, objects, and encapsulation to create complex software systems. OOP separates the functional requirements of an application into individual, self-contained, interrelated units called "objects." These objects are designed to interact with each other according to predetermined rules or policies, known as "class relationships."

In OOP, classes represent abstract entities that have properties and behaviors. They can be defined by their class name (e.g., Person), properties (e.g., name and age) and behaviors (e.g., getName() and setAge()). Objects are concrete instances of a particular class and exist in the world as "objects" that are instantiated through the use of the new operator. Class relationships specify how objects interact with each other, such as by having methods that allow one object to be modified or accessed by another object.

By using OOP, developers can create complex software systems more easily and maintain them over time. It is also an effective way to handle data-driven applications as it allows the separation of data from code for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, OOP helps ensure that code follows a clear and structured design pattern, which can improve the overall quality and efficiency of software development.
