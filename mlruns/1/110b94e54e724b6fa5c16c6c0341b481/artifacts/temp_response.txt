Microservices is a software development approach that divides an application into independent services, each serving a specific purpose and functioning independently of one another. This allows for better scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability by breaking down the codebase into smaller, more manageable components. Microservices can be integrated seamlessly into existing systems or new development projects by following best practices for design, testing, and deployment.
