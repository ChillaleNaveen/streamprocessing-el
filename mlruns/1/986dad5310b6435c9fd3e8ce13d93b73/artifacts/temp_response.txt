Fossil fuels are a group of organic compounds derived from non-living materials such as coal, oil, and gas. They consist of hydrocarbons (carbon and hydrogen) that have been formed through geological processes over millions or billions of years, thus becoming fossils. The term "fossil fuel" describes these organic compounds and their energy content.
