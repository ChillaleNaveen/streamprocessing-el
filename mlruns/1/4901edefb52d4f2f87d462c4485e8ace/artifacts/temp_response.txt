To use regular expressions in Python, you can use the built-in `re` module or third-party libraries such as `regex` or `sre_utils`. Here are some examples:

1. Basic Regular Expression Syntax:

```python
import re

pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"  # matches alphabets, digits, and underscores
print(re.match(pattern, "Hello World"))  # will print True since "Hello World" matches the pattern

# or to match any character (not just letters and numbers):
print(re.search(r"\w+", "Python is cool!").group())  # will print "P" since Python is cool! matches the pattern
```

2. Using a Pattern as a Function:

```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
    return re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$", email)  # matches valid email format

valid = is_valid_email("example@gmail.com")
print(valid)  # will print True since email "example@gmail.com" matches the pattern
```

3. Using a Pattern with Grouping:

```python
import re

def get_sum(numbers):
    match = re.match(r"\d+", numbers[0])
    return int(match.group()) + sum([int(x) for x in numbers])

numbers = ["123", "456", "789"]
result = get_sum(numbers)
print(f"The sum of {len(numbers)} numbers is: {result}")  # will print "106" since the sum of [123, 456, 789] is 106
```

Note that regular expressions are not case-sensitive in Python. If you're using a pattern that requires capitalization (e.g., "Hello World"), you can use `re.IGNORECASE` to ignore case while matching the pattern.
