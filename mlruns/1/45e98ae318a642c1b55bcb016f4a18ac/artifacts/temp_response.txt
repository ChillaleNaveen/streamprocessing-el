Cross-validation is a machine learning technique used in data analysis to evaluate the generalization ability of a model. It involves splitting the dataset into two parts, each with roughly equal size, for training and testing purposes. The model is then trained on one set (the "training set"), and evaluated on the other set (the "test set"). This process is repeated multiple times, with different subsets of the training set used as the test set in each iteration. By analyzing the predicted outcomes of the test set based on the predictions made by the model on the training set, it's possible to evaluate the generalization ability of the model and identify any potential issues. This technique is widely used in machine learning and is considered a crucial step towards building more accurate models.
