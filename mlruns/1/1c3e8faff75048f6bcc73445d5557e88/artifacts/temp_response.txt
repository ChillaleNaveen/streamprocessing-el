To measure customer satisfaction, businesses use various methods and metrics such as surveys, feedback forms, social media monitoring, customer service inquiries, and website analytics. These can be used to understand customer satisfaction levels, identify areas for improvement, and provide opportunities for personalized customer experiences. Additionally, businesses may also use external third-party data sources, such as Google Analytics or Customer 360, which provide insights into customer behavior and preferences based on demographics, geography, and other factors.
