Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, is a system designed to manage and track all interactions between a company and its customers, from initial contact to post-sale follow-up. It helps businesses gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and needs, allowing them to better understand their clients and respond to their needs in a more personalized way. By having a complete picture of their customers' interactions with the company, CRM allows companies to provide excellent service, improve sales, and enhance customer loyalty.
