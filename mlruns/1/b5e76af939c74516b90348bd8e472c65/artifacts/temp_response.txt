Yes, of course! Here's how you can use regular expressions in Java:

1. Create a regular expression:

   ```java
   String regex = "^[0-9]"; // Matches any number from 0 to 9 (exclusive)
   Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex); // Creates the regular expression using the given regular expression as the pattern
   Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("1234"); // Creates a new matcher object with the given regular expression as the pattern and the string "1234" as the input
   ```

2. Use regular expressions in code:

   ```java
   String number = "1234"; // A string containing a valid number from 0 to 9 (exclusive)
   Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex); // Creates the regular expression using the given regular expression as the pattern
   Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(number); // Creates a new matcher object with the given regular expression and the string "1234" as the input
   if (matcher.matches()) {
     System.out.println("The entered number is valid!");
   } else {
     System.out.println("Invalid input! The entered number is not a valid number from 0 to 9 (exclusive).");
   }
   ```
