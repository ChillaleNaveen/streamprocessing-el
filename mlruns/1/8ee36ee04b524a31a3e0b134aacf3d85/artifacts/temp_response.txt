To sort a list in Python, follow these steps:

1. Use the `sort()` method to sort the elements of the list in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest):

```python
my_list = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_list)
```

Explanation:
- We first create a new `my_list` by referencing the original one.
- We then call the `sort()` method on it with an argument of `True`, which means to sort in ascending order (i.e., largest to smallest). This will ensure that the elements are sorted numerically, not alphabetically.
- The output of this step is a new list called `sorted_list`.

2. Use the `sorted()` method to convert the list to a sorted list:

```python
my_list = [2, 5, 1, 3, 4]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print("Sorted list as sorted by ascending order (using sorted()):", sorted_list)
```

Explanation:
- We first create a new `my_list` by referencing the original one.
- We then call the `sorted()` method on it with an argument of `True`, which means to sort in ascending order (i.e., largest to smallest). This will ensure that the elements are sorted numerically, not alphabetically.
- The output of this step is a new list called `sorted_list`.
