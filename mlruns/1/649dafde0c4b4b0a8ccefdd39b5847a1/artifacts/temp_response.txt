Database normalization, also known as database schema design, is a process of creating and maintaining consistent and relational database structures to improve data management and prevent data inconsistencies. It helps in reducing errors, increasing security, and improving the overall efficiency and scalability of the database. In simple terms, database normalization involves creating a set of rules that define how data can be stored, accessed, and manipulated in a database. The goal is to ensure that data is organized in a way that minimizes the risk of errors or inconsistencies, maximizes performance and scalability, and ensures a common schema for all tables within the database.
