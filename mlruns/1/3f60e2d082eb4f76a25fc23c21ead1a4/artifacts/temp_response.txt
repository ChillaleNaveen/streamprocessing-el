Database normalization is a technique used in database design to create a consistent and reliable structure that helps to optimize data retrieval, querying, and management. It ensures that data in the database are organized logically to facilitate easy access and maintenance. Normalization involves breaking down complex relationships between tables into simpler ones, thereby reducing the number of columns and relationships required for the database schema. This helps to minimize redundancy and makes it easier to maintain and update the database as changes are made.
