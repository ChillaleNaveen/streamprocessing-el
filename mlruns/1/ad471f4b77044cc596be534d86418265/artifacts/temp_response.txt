A/B Testing is a popular marketing method that allows businesses to test two different versions of an advertisement or product to see which one receives more clicks, leads, or conversions. It involves creating two separate variations of the same ad or product and comparing their performance in different environments or conditions. The goal is to find out which version performs better and optimize for it to increase the success rate of its campaigns.
