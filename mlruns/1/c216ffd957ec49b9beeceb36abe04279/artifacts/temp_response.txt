Dimensionality reduction, also known as principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis, is a technique used in machine learning and data mining to reduce the dimension of a large dataset or set of variables to a smaller set of variables that represent its underlying patterns and trends. This process involves identifying the most essential characteristics or features that explain the overall variability of the data, while eliminating irrelevant or redundant variables. Dimensionality reduction is commonly used in fields such as biomedical research, finance, and marketing, among others, to reduce complex datasets into more manageable and usable formats for analysis and interpretation.
