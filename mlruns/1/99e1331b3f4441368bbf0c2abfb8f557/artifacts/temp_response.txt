A name for a coding bootcamp could be "Codable" or "Coder's Academy." These names are catchy, easy to remember and convey the idea of a dynamic and supportive community of coders. They also provide a clear and memorable tagline that highlights the program's focus on teaching practical skills and providing opportunities for networking and collaboration.
