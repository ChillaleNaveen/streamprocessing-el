A/B Testing is a form of experimentation designed to evaluate two or more alternatives in order to determine which one performs better and should be the primary option for your target audience. This type of testing involves creating two versions (or "alternatives") of an asset such as a website, email campaign, or social media post, with each version being presented to different segments of your audience. The goal is to determine which version receives the most engagement and conversions, ultimately leading to the successful implementation of one or more of these alternatives.
