LaMBA (Lambda-Based Machine Learning Applications) is a set of machine learning algorithms that can be run on any programming language, including Python, R, and MATLAB. They are designed to perform complex tasks in a single step or pipeline, with minimal data preprocessing needed, and they can be easily reused across multiple models and applications. LaMBA functions are written using a high-level language interface (such as Python or R), which simplifies the programming process and facilitates easy integration with other tools and datasets. In summary, laMBA is a set of machine learning algorithms designed to perform complex tasks in a single step or pipeline, with minimal data preprocessing needed, making them highly flexible and efficient for various applications.
