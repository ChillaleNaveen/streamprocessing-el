The main difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can be summarized as follows:

1. Difference in approach: ML is a subset of AI, which uses algorithms to extract insights from data. It focuses on solving specific problems by finding patterns and relationships. On the other hand, AI is a broader field that includes both ML and non-ML applications. 2. Functionality: AI systems are designed to perform tasks automatically based on predefined rules or procedures. This is often done through algorithms that analyze data and make predictions or recommendations. In contrast, ML is a powerful tool for building intelligent systems with the ability to learn from data and make decisions autonomously. 3. Capabilities: AI systems can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, image recognition, and speech synthesis. In contrast, ML techniques are limited by their ability to handle large amounts of data, as well as the specific nature of the problem at hand. Overall, the focus and approach of AI systems are very different from those used in ML, leading to distinct capabilities and applications.
