Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that involves building and testing software from end to end in a repeatable and controlled manner. In TDD, developers write tests for each feature or functionality before writing code for it, then incorporate the test results into the code itself. This process ensures that the code meets the required standards while also providing valuable feedback on what needs improvement. It's an iterative development methodology where continuous testing and feedback loops are used to optimize the software.
