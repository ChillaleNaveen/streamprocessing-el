Project management works by breaking down a complex task or project into smaller, more manageable tasks and assigning them to team members. This process involves establishing goals, defining tasks, setting timelines, prioritizing tasks based on their importance and urgency, creating a schedule for each task, assigning resources (such as time, money, or personnel) to each task, communicating with stakeholders, monitoring progress, and making adjustments to the plan as needed. By following these steps, project managers can ensure that each task is completed within scope, on budget, and in a timely manner.
