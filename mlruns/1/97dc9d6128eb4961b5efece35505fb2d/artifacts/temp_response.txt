Akin to a human brain, a neural network is a complex collection of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and make decisions based on input signals received from various sources. The structure and functioning of a neural network are inspired by the human nervous system, which consists of billions of neurons working in concert to send and receive signals.

Similarly, neural networks use layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) to process data and make decisions based on input signals received from various sources. Each layer or "layer" is a separate set of nodes that performs a specific function, such as feature extraction, classification, or regression. The number and type of layers can vary depending on the task at hand.

In summary, neural networks are analogous to human brains in terms of structure and functioning, with each layer performing a specific function and connecting to other layers via connections called "connections." By incorporating various types of neurons, connections, and inputs, neural networks can solve complex problems in a variety of applications.
