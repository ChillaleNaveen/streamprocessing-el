The main distinction between artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) lies in their respective approaches to data analysis and decision-making. AI utilizes algorithms, models, and algorithms that have been trained with massive amounts of data to perform specific tasks with high accuracy and efficiency. On the other hand, ML is a more general framework for building intelligent systems that learn from and adapt to data over time. ML focuses on modeling and predictive analysis while AI is focused on understanding and manipulating data.
