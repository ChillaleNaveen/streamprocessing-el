Blockchain technology is a decentralized and immutable ledger that exists across multiple nodes (computers) in a network. It works by recording all transactions (events) in a chain of blocks, starting with the first block and moving forward until the last block in the chain. Any new transaction can only be added to the end of the chain, thus creating a record of all previous transactions.

The main benefit of blockchain technology is its decentralization, which means that no single entity (i.e., company or government) has control over it. This ensures that the network and all users are protected from any cyberattacks or data breaches caused by unauthorized access. Additionally, the chain cannot be forged or tampered with, making blockchain transactions secure and trustworthy.

In summary, blockchain technology works by creating a decentralized ledger that records all transactions over time, while ensuring that only authorized nodes can add new blocks to the end of the chain. This provides a secure and immutable record of all previous transactions in the network.
