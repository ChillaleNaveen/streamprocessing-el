Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes the testing of code as it's being developed. The goal is to write tests for every part of the program, and then use them as a guide to write the necessary code. In TDD, developers start with functional tests (i.e., tests that verify the program does what it should do) before writing any non-functional tests (i.e., tests that verify the correctness of the code). This approach is known as "test-driven development," and it encourages a continuous loop of testing, coding, and debugging to identify bugs and errors early in the development process.
