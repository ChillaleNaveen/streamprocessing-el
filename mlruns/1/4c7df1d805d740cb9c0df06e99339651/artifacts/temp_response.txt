Answer: The human immune system works by fighting off foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites. It is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that are designed to protect the body from infection and disease by identifying and destroying infected cells or organisms.

In summary, the human immune system works by:
- Developing specialized immune cells (e.g., monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils) that can recognize and kill invading pathogens
- Producing antibodies that can bind to and neutralize specific pathogen proteins or glycoproteins
- Recruiting and activating other immune cells (e.g., T cells, B cells) to attack the infected organism
- Regulating the immune response by controlling the number and type of inflammatory cells in the body, as well as by suppressing the growth of cancerous cells
- Coordinating with other defense mechanisms (e.g., vaccination, dietary changes) to achieve optimal protection against infectious agents.
