Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach that helps businesses manage their interactions with customers, including sales, support, and marketing. It aims to create a culture of customer engagement by providing tools and strategies for analyzing data, identifying trends, and prioritizing actions based on the needs and preferences of each customer. By doing so, CRM helps businesses develop long-term relationships with their customers, increase loyalty, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
