A/B testing, also known as split testing or variation testing, is a digital marketing technique that involves conducting two different variations of a campaign to determine which one generates the most conversions and leads. This testing allows businesses to optimize their advertising efforts by testing different content, messaging, layouts, and calls-to-action (CTAs) to see what works best for their audience. By running A/B tests, businesses can identify which version of a campaign performs better, ultimately leading to increased revenue and customer loyalty.
