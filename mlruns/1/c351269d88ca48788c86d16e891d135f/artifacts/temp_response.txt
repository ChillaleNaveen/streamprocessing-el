Database normalization, also known as database integrity, is a technique designed to ensure that data in a relational database is consistent and organized. It involves creating tables with relationships between them to minimize the potential for data errors or inconsistencies. Normalization helps to prevent data duplication, ensures data consistency, and reduces complexity by simplifying the structure of the database.
