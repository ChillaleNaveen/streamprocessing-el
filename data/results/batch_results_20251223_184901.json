    "response": "Fossil fuels are a group of organic compounds derived from non-living materials such as coal, oil, and gas. They consist of hydrocarbons (carbon and hydrogen) that have been formed through geological processes over millions or billions of years, thus becoming fossils. The term \"fossil fuel\" describes these organic compounds and their energy content.",

    "category": "general",
    "complexity": "low",
    "response": "Photosynthesis, also known as photosynthesis or green plants, is a process in which green and brown algae, cyanobacteria, and some types of plants use light energy from sunlight to produce organic molecules such as carbohydrates (glucose), fats, proteins, and nucleotides (building blocks for DNA). The process begins when a chlorophyll molecule absorbs a photon of light, which triggers the release of electrons that are used by enzymes to transfer energy to other molecules within the plant. This energy is stored in the form of chemical bonds and is later used to produce food or fuel for the plant's growth and survival. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll is the primary pigment responsible for absorbing light energy from sunlight, while the enzyme ATP synthase produces the protons (positive ions) that carry out the electron transport chain, which ultimately transfers electrons to other molecules within the plant. By capturing light energy through chlorophyll, plants can convert sunlight into chemical energy, which is then used for cellular respiration and organelle synthesis, among other things.",

    "category": "data_science",
    "complexity": "medium",
    "response": "K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that uses multiple centroids (or means) to group data points into k distinct clusters, where k is a specified number of clusters. It involves iteratively updating the centroids until convergence or a prescribed stopping criterion is reached. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Initialization: The algorithm begins by assigning each data point to the nearest centroid. Let xi be the i-th data point and let ck be its k-th closest centroid.\n\n2. Calculate distances: For each data point, calculate the distance between it and its closest centroid.\n\n3. Update centroids: Based on the calculated distances, update the centroids of each cluster until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.\n\n4. Update centroids: For each cluster, find the average of the k-1 nearest centroids.\n\n5. Repeat: Repeat steps 3-5 for as many iterations as needed until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.\n\n6. Assign data points to clusters: The algorithm assigns each data point to the cluster with the highest similarity to its most similar center, which is determined by the last iteration's average centroid.\n\nOverall, k-means clustering aims to find the optimal set of k centroids that best represents the data points. The choice of k depends on the problem at hand and can be tuned using cross-validation or other techniques.",

The resulting sorted list will be `[20, 30, 40, 10]`. You can also use other sorting methods like \"reverse\" or \"ascending\".",
